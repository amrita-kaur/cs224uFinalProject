16165,"AITA for getting a gift in the mail? I got a gift in the mail today. Addressed to me with my address and my full name (people usually call me by my nickname). There were two necklaces, a ring, a guitar tuner with batteries, guitar strings and a tactical weapon to use in your fist if you want to punch someone.

My fiance is accusing me of cheating on him because the handwriting on the box looks like a man may have wrote it.

I'm definitely not cheating on him. Someone knows my full name and obviously knows I'm learning guitar. I'm seriously freaked out and worried about it because of the tactical tool in the box, too.

My plan of action is calling the USPS tomorrow and see if there is any info on the tracking number. After that, I'm calling the police to make a report to have on record.

My fiance is telling me that he thinks I'm cheating on him because of all this stuff. My fiance is out of his ever-loving mind if he thinks I'd do that. I'll be 49 soon and I'm wayyyyy too old for that shit. I'm a good, honest woman. If I had something to hide, why would I show him? Makes no sense. I've offered to show him my internet history but he refuses to look at it.

I'm taking precautionary measures tomorrow in case I have a stalker somehow. Does that make me an asshole for getting a package of stuff I didn't want?",
20983,"AITA for being fat and wanting a not fat husband? Back at it again with another AITA post. TLDR at the end.

In my last post I was deemed to be an asshole about that (rightfully so), but I mentioned something that sparked some small side debate in the comments and even a damn private message. So now I must know if I'm the asshole for this too.

&#x200B;

I said in the post

\>I don’t want him to be fat, because I’m working hard not to be fat and I want a life partner with healthy habits.

I am an obese woman. My goal weight is 175lbs. At this moment I am 140lbs overweight, I was originally 205lbs overweight before I started getting my shit together. And part of that can be attributed to moving out on my own and finally being able to decide what my diet is.

&#x200B;

The struggle has been real for me with this damned food. Its the bane of my existence, but everyone in my life is super encouraging and I love them to pieces for it, but sometimes I still lack motivation and WANT to make stupid choices, but I don't make them as often as I want because there's no terrible food around me and I don't have people constantly trying to go out to eat or eating junk food surrounding me.

&#x200B;

So I don't want to reintroduce unhealthiness into my life when I know that food is always going to be a struggle for me. Therefore, I don't want a fat husband. I'm not talking about someone with some pudge. I mean I don't want an obese husband or even a thin husband with unhealthy eating habits. I want someone who is conscious of their health. If it's a bigger man, and he's dedicated to living a healthy life and losing weight, that's fine. So reddit... AITA for this?

&#x200B;

TLDR; AITA for wanting a husband who is healthy even though I am currently obese?

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: I'm not trying to say that weight is a sole indicator of health but I do know that someone who is 300+lbs and eats fast food daily isn't healthy. And someone who is obese is generally not healthy. I also don't support the ""healthy at every size"" movement because you're not healthy at 400lbs and you cannot convince me otherwise.

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm single there is no husband in the picture. This is something I'd be looking for in a future partner.",
40011,"WIBTA if I didn’t give my staff free shirts because there’s not a size for everyone? So for starters, I run a bar and a few weeks back I announced we’d be running a promo (this Friday) on a specific drink and that there’d be swag to give out and so on. As part of the promo I was told I would be able to get free shirts for the staff so I collected everyone’s sizes. Most of them wanted smalls and mediums but there was one request for a large and one request for a 2XL. I relayed all of our shirt sizes to the beverage rep and she told me she’d see what she could do.

Fast forward to yesterday and the beverage rep delivered the shirts, yay! Except they are all smalls and mediums with one large. So now I am left with one person without a shirt and that person is one who stays until close while most of the others are cut out early. She also has privately discussed with me that weight is a very sensitive topic for her, so I do not wish to upset her at all. Since I do not have a shirt for her I plan on telling my staff there was a change of plans and that the shirts will be given out to customers. I ran this by one of my senior staff and she threw a fit and said that life isn’t fair so I shouldn’t take away the free shirt from everyone else just because there isn’t one for one of them. 

So, WIBTA if I took away a gift from everyone just because one person wouldn’t be able to enjoy it?",
61256,"AITA for cutting off my mom? So there’s A LOT of context behind this. About two years ago I came out to her as transgender (mtf) and for a while she was super supportive.  When I started HRT she instantly changed and became aggressive against the idea.  She would threaten me with disowning, cutting me off financially, and used college as a bargaining chip against me.  This became extremely emotionally draining, as all of our discussions degraded into us fighting.  She would give the usual “you’re too young” and “i know you better and all your friends are brainwashed”.  It has degraded to the point where she believes in a medical conspiracy that is pushing me to be trans. I intentionally tried to avoid her and refused to come home to visit during holidays.  

The final straw came when I was in the hospital after a mental health episode and she has been shaming me for getting mental help.  She stated that I only when to the psych ward because “I wanted to get out of an exam”. I essentially told her that if she “Can’t swallow her pride long enough to admit she’s wrong then she has no reason to call this number”.  This, along with her threats of using this event as legal grounds to declare me incompetent has led to this decision.

There are other things as well, including her berating me for having mental health issues (since middle school) despite the fact they run particularly strong on my dad’s side.  Along with that, my father passed away 4 years ago and she began speaking worse and worse about him to the point she tried to convince me that I was abused.  She often uses this as justification for her actions despite the fact my dad knew I was queer since childhood and never once acted in malice against it.

I am concerned because she still tries to maintain that she treats me this way out of love but my mental health always improves dramatically when I’m away from her. She’s threatened that my family will “come after me” if I ever cut ties with her and I am partly concerned for my safety.  I have enough money and a deal made with the university so I can finish college without debt but I still fear what my mother might try to do to me legally since I had a severe breakdown earlier in the year.  I know she does this in some misguided intent of caring for me but I cannot mentally take it anymore as it has proven to be extremely detrimental to my health and safety. AITA for cutting ties with her?",
41686,"AITA for asking my wife to not get my name tattooed on her? We have been together for 15 years this December. Like all relationships we have had our fair share of ups and downs, but are still very much in love. She is my best friend and I’m hers. I couldn’t imagine my life without her. So why wouldn’t I want her to tattoo my name on her you might ask, well that’s a much longer story. 

&#x200B;

However, for as long as I can remember I’ve been dealing with depression, anxiety, social isolation, poor self esteem and loneliness. I didn’t know how to talk to people about my feelings or even truly understood what I was feeling. As I grow older, my anxiety and depression has continued to grow stronger. Not really understanding why, I really started to reflect heavily on my life, which is pretty amazing to be honest. I have a loving wife, amazing children, and a pretty good job. Still this monster continued to grow. After a lot of self reflecting and conversations with my wife, I’ve realized that I suffer from gender dysphoria. 

&#x200B;

This came as a shocking revelation, though there have always been signs. I’ve always enjoyed wearing female clothing. I’ve always felt more connected to females, and most of my friends are female. Even though I’m happily married to my wife, I’ve always been sexual attraction to men. These things have always lead to a feeling of shame. I can remember when I was around 5 years old, my parents caught me trying on some pantyhose. They had a very long conversation with me (yelling actually) about how wrong it was. Since then I’ve always had feelings of shame. Not allowing anyone to know that I enjoyed being girly, as it was shameful and unnatural, until I told my wife 8 years ago. Typing this it seems silly now, but I convinced (or fooled) myself that I was a normal guy. It was normal for men to want to be female (still to this point honestly don't understand how they couldn’t). I debate this with my wife, whom says most men don’t feel this way. It has been a long road to get where I am today and my wife has been 100% supportive of me.

&#x200B;

I plan on being married to her for the rest of my life. I can’t imagine ever being with anyone else. I don’t know if I will ever transition. However having my current name tattooed on her, would be a constant reminder to me of my male self. She stats it would be a good thing to remember who I was, but all I can think of is the fact there will always be people to remind me of who I was and who I never will truly be. I also feel like I’m corrupting her perception of who I am or in the future who I was. Which I’m not. I myself would see that as a total asshole move, and even told her she could get my name as her tattoo, but I still have a hard time coping with it. We’ve talked about her getting a symbol to represent me as a tattoo. I know that’s not what she truly wants, and with everything that is going on, I can’t help but feel that I’m being selfish.

&#x200B;

So am I an asshole?",
26519,"AITA for having my own WiFi and changing the password? I’ve been living with P & Q for almost a year now. P is a person I knew from high school. Q is somebody I met briefly at a bar a year or two ago. It just so happened that the two of them live together and P asked me if I wanted to move in to a bedroom that was recently vacated. When I first moved in a year ago, I noticed that the house had a router, but I assumed that it belonged to P or Q. I had brought along a lot of devices for my room to connect to the Internet and I didn’t want to slow down their Internet. So, I decided to get my own router. I had mentioned it to P beforehand and he didn’t ask any questions about it. While I was setting it up, P was gone to see his family for the weekend and Q was in and out of the house, but he didn’t ask any questions about it. After some time, I noticed a couple things. First, the router in the house belonged to the landlord. Second, I found that my router’s signal was slightly stronger than the other router. I assumed it was due to the fact that the other router already had a bunch of devices connected to it and so I didn’t think much of it. 

A month ago, I noticed that my WiFi was acting a lot slower than usual. I decided to check the device list for the WiFi and noticed a few devices listed online that I didn’t recognize. So, I reset my router and change the password. I didn’t think much of this either until a day later when Q mentioned that he got booted off the WiFi (he referred to it by the name of the router manufacturer) and had to go back to the old WiFi at the house. That’s when I remembered that I had signed his laptop onto the WiFi a couple months ago since we were trying to watch a livestream of a football game and his WiFi (from the original router) was dropping in and out. While he left to go grab something from his room, I switched his laptop over to my WiFi. We were both pretty drunk at the time. So, neither of us remembered it (until recently for me) and Q never brought it up to me. I realize now that Q’s laptop was one of those devices. 

Now, Q always mentions how he got booted off and is not sure why/what happened. It’s put me in a bit of an awkward spot because I’m not sure if I’m an asshole for withholding my WiFi from my roommates. If I tell them about how I have my own router, I’m afraid that they’ll get mad at me for withholding it from them. While I told P about it long ago and Q saw me set it up, I don’t know if they remember that. 

Part of that fear also stems from a gradual falling out that I’m having with them (Q especially), where Q has explicitly said that he wished I didn’t live at the house and that he would’ve moved out if he had known earlier that I was moving in. So, I don’t foresee the friendship really extending beyond the moment I leave. Right now, I’m planning on just kinda keeping the situation as it is right now and just enduring the awkwardness until the end of our lease in a few weeks. Am I an asshole for doing this?",
64522,"AITA for not telling my best friends wife he was cheating on her? I've been debating this for weeks and I'm still unsure. 

My best friend, a guy (I'm female) has been having an affair, it's not the first time he has done something like this. The wife knew about one instance and forgave it. He didn't leave because he thought they could fix it and I think she was always scared to leave him. 

 I'm absolutely not defending his behaviour other than to say they were unhappy and its simply taken a long time to leave her because she kept putting that decision on him. They had issues but nothing huge, just small things that pilled up, another reason why it took so long for things to end. 

A few weeks ago we had a talk and he let slip that he's been playing around, I had a suspicion but he refused to tell me due to knowing I'd lose my shit. After he told me, it took another week for him to end his nearly two decade long marriage and I felt relived that it was finally done. 

My issue is, am I an asshole for not going to her with my suspicion that he was cheating? Bare in mind I've know her as long as I've known him but he is my friend, she was simply a friend through being his wife. Some part of me feels like it would have ended sooner if I'd told her, maybe saving her time she could have spent recovering but probably destroying my friendship with my bf in the process. Some part of me has that need for female solidarity and feels like I betrayed the sisterhood. One reason I didn't tell her was because he said he was ending it eventually, even when I had my suspicion months ago, he was adamant he was ending his marriage it was just about when. So I figured it would be better if she didn't know. That last part is void because she now knows and she's furious (rightly so). 

It's just an awkward situation and I'm not sure if I should have done things differently? AITA here?",
32476,"WIBTA for cutting my family out of my life when I turn 17 I'm gonna try to keep it simple. Things for me at home aren't exactly all that nice. My parents are constantly fighting and want a divorce. my mother's basically never present at this point and literally ONLY comes home for food or a place to sleep for the night (She spends the rest of the time with her boyfriend, whom I'm not too fond of due to his background and past acts, and the fact that he has been arrested multiple times. But my mom believes everyone deserves a second chance.) This always has my dad being agitated or things like that, and he often vents it by yelling at us or ranting for a while. and my mother always says that ""she loves us"" yet she basically acts like we don't exist anymore. not to mention they want me to choose who to go live with. which I don't want to hurt either party. So I've been refusing to choose one. But I'm sick of this lifestyle, I'm leaving as soon as I turn 17 (About 7 months from now.) and I haven't told either of them my plans yet because I know they'll do everything in their power to stop me. But I'm not happy with the way I'm living right now. my current plan is that the day I turn 17, I'm gonna leave town and state with a couple thousand dollars that I'm earning from a job I work at. I may or may not tell the day before. but all I know is that I WILL be doing that.. But when I do that, I want to just start a new life, that means dropping connections with my current family that's basically falling apart day by day, which already forces me in an unhappy situation that I want out of. 

WIBTA for leaving for leaving even against their will and just trying to force myself out of the situation?

TL;DR I'm leaving town and state when I turn 17, whether or not my parents will be against doesn't change what I will do. but that also means I'll be dropping my connections to them a lot and will be almost independent of them, requiring little, if anything at all from them. WIBTA?

Edit: the Legal age of being allowed to leave the household is 17 in my state, I've done a little research, not to mention my sister did the same thing when she turned 17 as well and the fighting started. Also, Where I'll be moving to, the people I'll stay with won't face any legal trouble, I've done my research a bit.",
68006,"AITA for choosing not to do anything about an annoying classmate being called names? Throwaway account because my friends follow my regular one and I’d rather they not see this. 

So I’m a junior in high school and like all juniors in high school, most of us look down on the freshmen. But I really try not to. I’ve gotten to know some really sweet freshies on the swim team, and the ones who go to Gender-Sexuality Alliance too. Obviously I understand the resent, as I was pretty chaotic as a freshman myself. But overall, I try to see past that. 

However, there’s this one kid in my band class. We’ll call him Neil. He plays oboe and does so pretty well, but he is probably the most annoying freshman I know of. And this ain’t a thing of most people love him but I don’t vibe with him. No. This kid is very much disliked by our entire band class because of his snarky, pretentious attitude. 

To give you some examples, one time my band director was correcting the double reeds on something, and out of nowhere Neil suddenly says, “My mom’s a doctor!” People laughed, not with him but at him. I, who sit right near to him, shot a look at my stand partner, and we both silently said to each other, “This is happening.”

He also one time called a lot of my upperclassmen friends bitches for no apparent reason. He’s been in high school for no more than a month. 

Then at our first football game of the marching season, we were told to wear black and red, our school colors, since we didn’t have our uniforms ready yet. And everyone shows up accordingly, all except for Neil, who comes with a bright blue sweater and gray shorts. When he was asked why, he went, “I mean I own black and red clothes but I didn’t feel like changing.” Not an excuse, if you ask me. 

So you’ve got the gist of things, now we get on to the important bit. So Neil’s an Indian-American, and he’s also very short and speaks with a high-pitched voice. His face also happens to be quite punchable. Not that anyone has punched his face, but who knows. 

So because of that, the band kids (mostly sophomores who tend to be nastiest to the freshies) started calling him Baljeet, after the character from Phineas and Ferb. I’m hearing it everywhere now, and everywhere Neil goes people start going “Eyyyy Baljeet!” He’s told them to stop, but no one has. 

I hate bullying. I’ve been there, done that. It’s an awful experience and I don’t want people to go through it. But now I don’t know what to do. I feel like if Neil had a better attitude about band, and was nicer to people than he’s been, people would take to him better. But you can’t ever justify being deliberately mean to someone. And he’s told them to stop, and so far I haven’t done anything. I’m a bystander. 

He’s not the only freshie with attitude problems, so I’m thinking of gathering all of the freshies in band and just giving them a gentle wake up call about their attitude. Who knows if it’ll work. 

So for the time being, AITA for not doing anything about an annoying kid getting called names?",
75861,"AITA Trying to order takeout I won't name the restaurant. Every Tuesday is pasta night. I think it's $5 off for any pasta.

It's large portions so it's enough for 2 meals. The plan was order some pasta and take it to work for 2nd shift. Perfect for 2 nights of dinner.

So I place my order to go. I was told the special only applies to eat-in, not take out. I don't understand this but say fine. So I take a seat at a table. They bring my food. I take a bite, tell them I'm full and want the rest in a doggy bag to go.

Why did I have to waste everyone's time to get my food? Take up table space, dirty some dishes etc. Either way the server got his 20% tip. I couldn't order a beer because I was on the way to work.

A couple of weeks later I went back. The server recognized me and let me do takeout. No problems. This went on for a couple months. Next time I went in the server told me his boss have him shit for doing it. So I had to to sit down again, order, them ask for a doggy bag. I guess this made his boss happy.

AITA?

Edit: for clarity.
My options are to eat in and pay $20 with tip or take out and pay $20 with tip. Since I don't order drinks or dessert in either scenario the cost is the same both ways.

I will sit in next time and finish half before taking the rest out. Full price or sale I can't eat more than that anyways. The only difference is I'm now taking up space and dirtying dishes.

70500,"WIBTA If I go around my teacher and help my class? Okay, so this is pretty simple, and I hope that it doesn't get removed for validation, but I'm actually nervous about the reaction of my teacher and then my parents.

So I'm a sophomore in high school (10th grade, 15m). At my school, the administration requires teachers to have both a Google Classroom page and a Google Calendar, both for keeping track of assignments. My biology teacher has both of these things but skirts around the rules a little bit.

The Google Classroom is basically barren because she doesn't post to it. The only thing on it is a link to her 'website' (section on a laggy school website). The other thing is the Google Calendar page. What bugs me about it is that she just put ""See Unit 2 Sheet"" on almost every day. The Unit 2 Sheet also has a calendar on it, and it's a paper version that she hands out at the beginning of every month, but if someone doesn't have the paper, there's a good chance that they don't know the homework.

Yesterday some of the kids in the class confronted her on this, and said that it was kind of useless to have a Calendar, which sparked her on a rant about how we were never going to survive in the real world if we expected this kind of treatment, that back in her day people used planners and Google didn't exist. Standard boomer ranting material.

I came up with an idea, which is that since the month is almost over, at the start of November, I would create a calendar and actually write all the stuff in it, and post it to her classroom, basically giving every student what they want.

WIBTA if I do this?

At first, when the two were in the designated children's area, it was fine that the child was having fun and making noise, as it wasn't bothering anyone. However, when she brought her child into the main part of the library where it is generally quieter, the woman continued to play with her child in the same manner, making enough noise to disrupt other customers. 

I thought to myself that she should either quieten down or go back into the children's area where they were free to make noise. But then I got busy doing something else and forgot about it. A couple of minutes later, an elderly man reading a newspaper spoke up to the woman. I had no idea what he said, but he ended up leaving in a mood.

The woman then came up to the counter with her child and told me that the man told her to 'get lost' at the end of their argument. Rather than apologize and end the issue (which I probably should have done), I explained that there is a designated children's area, where there is plenty of space to run around and make noise. Then she said she doesn't understand my viewpoint and that children should be encouraged to come into libraries and restructuring them to one area won't do that.

55731,"AITA for telling a guy I'd date him before ghosting him? So, last summer, I went to a party with my best friend. One of the boys there hands us two drinks, so we start drinking. Well...

I’m not good at holding my liquor. I don’t know what they gave me, but I don’t even want to talk about the state I was in for the rest of the night. Not my proudest moment. Anyway, I was chatting with some boys I didn’t really know, and one of them stood out to me.

In a normal situation, he may would’ve been my type. He wasn’t handsome, but he was really smart, kinda shy, etc. We start talking. I get the feeling he’s cute, but once again, I’m dead drunk. So at one point, I told my bf et one of her guy friends (we’ll call him C) that I find thi guy (let’s call him T) really cute and that’d I 100% date him.

I guess C told T to try his luck because next thing I knew, T was taking me to an isolated spot.

I don’t even remember the moment he took me out, I was so drunk I had several black outs during the party. Anyway, we start chatting and stuff ; I was showing him pictures of my pets. All of a sudden, he kissed me.

I didn’t react. I laughed awkwardly, and even tho I don’t clearly picture this moment, I recall feelin something wasn't right. Like « oh wait, you’re kissing me in front of a picture of my doggo ? This ain’t cool ». I said nothing and just kept on showing him pics (drunk me ain’t the best decision maker). I just recall he kissed me several times after that, and I still didn’t react. Maybe I should’ve get up and left.

Then I received a call from my father. He was angry af. It was 4am and I had told him I’d be home at 12pm. I was startin to panick — my best friend was too drunk to take me home. T. offered me a ride home. I thought it was nice, and I didn’t really have any other choice. I completely blacked out the rest of the night. I think he kissed me before dropping me off but that’s about it.

That’s the last time I talked to him. Waking up in the morning, thinking about what had happened with T — it felt really wrong. He sent me a text + a pm on fb, but I didn’t answer. I should’ve told him I was not feeling comfortable with pursuing anything with him. But just looking at the notification of his texts made my heart sank.

I thought that was the end of it. But in December my best friend asks C if she can bring me as her +1 at his NYE party. We thought he’d be cool with it since we were on good terms (I hadn’t talk to or seen C since that party). 

To be short, he told her I wouldn't be welcome because of my slutty behavior by leading T on and then crushing his hopes. My bf argued that I was drunk, he was sober and should've known better than to get his hopes up on a drunk girl. But C insisted, tellin her T was a nice guy who didn't deserve that.

So all the boys in my hometown think I’m a massive slut. They come to me to tell me I shouldn’t have been such a bitch. I’m starting to think it really was my fault, that I shouldn’t have drunk that day. So, AITA ?",

Yet she ignored me and was active for hours after I said that question. So I’m very lost on this, am I the asshole for wishing her well? Did I say something wrong? I’m so lost",
59370,"AITA for telling my sister that she should let me stay a whole week at her apartment? I recently went on vacation to visit some friends and family. My daughter came with me. She's 5 and has a lot of energy but she is sweet and kind. When I told my sister I was coming she said I could stay with them (her, husband and one year old boy). They all sleep together in one room and we spend most of the day out of the apartment. When I am in the apartment, I help my sister with her baby because she gets lonely and overwhelmed. 

So the time came and I told her I was coming for a week. She hesitated and said she didn't want me to stay that long, but two days would be fine. I asked her why and she said she is just too stressed and it's different when it's our parents staying there because they help. Last time I was there, her boy was sick and I took care of him quite a bit and helped clean up. So I got upset when she said that. She said it feels too crowded and I said ""Okay, well you lived with my ex and me and our daughter for 9 months and it was crowded but family is family."" 

She ended up calling my parents crying hysterically and saying that I was mean to her. She also told them that I only helped like an hour last time I was there, which she later took back and admitted was much more than that. I don't get why she, a 26(f) did that. Of course, since I'm older, I got accused of being a bully. But when I showed my parents the messages, they said they really weren't mean. But my sister insists that it was manipulative (and even said I was like my abusive ex) to say that ""family is family"". AITA here? Should I apologize for that?

Over spring break I told him I didn’t know where to go yet because I didn’t have a car. He said he’s going home to see family so I could use his car to drive to spring break stuff with friends. I thought that was super nice as his car is very nice as well (Mercedes SUV). 

So he goes home and I get my best friends together for a spring break road trip. We end up driving to Las Vegas from Maryland which was a huge drive but super fun. When I get back my roommate asks how the trip was and I tell him and he FREAKS OUT. He said he assumed we were just gonna drive to the beach or something, like just a few hours away, not almost to the west coast. I told him he didn’t say anything about distance when he lent the car to me, and it’s unfair to get mad at me when he didn’t bother to say anything.

72834,"WIBTA if I asked my husband to help out more This is a throw away account, of course. So I’ll start off saying that my husband works a lot. I understand that when he gets home he is exhausted and he wants to relax. I am a stay at home mom with a toddler and a baby that two years apart. I know some people believe being a stay at home mom is easy and I can see how my job is different than my husband’s. My issue is at the end of the day. 

The night time route is what is the most stressful part of the day because I have to get the kids ready for bed, do nightly chores, and make sure the dogs are taken care of. At this point I’m exhausted and want to relax too. Right now my littlest one is teething so it’s been hard to get him to bed. At this point I’m already done mentally and physically. So while my husband is sitting in bed watching tv I’m fuming. I’ve tried to talk to him but, it always becomes an argument. I just want him to help out when he can instead of just sitting down all night. 

I know this sounds like I’m making excuses. I probably need to just suck it up because this comes with the job. I was fine before my second kid. I had PD right after he was born and I thought I had gotten better but, some days are worse than others. I’ve told him about my PD just haven’t told him it’s still going on.

He passed away from natural causes while incarcerated and serving a life sentence. His next parole hearing was in less than a year but he suffered from lung cancer (smoker) and he also had a hip injury last october which at 70 can lead to complications.

My father was a provider to a family of three kids, my mother never had to work. He paid for my sisters wedding. He paid for my brothers braces and dental work all out of pocket. At home I would say that he was kind to us 70% of the time.

However, my father was also a semi famous in our local area (in the late 80's and early 90's) as a murderer. He has now paid his due to society.

My sister (the one who got her wedding paid for) refused to attend his funeral, even though both me and my elderly mother asked. She says that our father was just a monster and that she doesnt want to participate in it. 

I feel very angry about this. I realize she is an adult but I also feel like she is being childish and over dramatic and extremely hurtful to not just me but my elderly mother who has lost the will to live.

571,"IMWTA for deleting her facebook? Sorry this is so long. This just happened.

My wife occasionally gets sad/down, and when that happens, she deactivates her facebook. Always a temporary delete, she always comes back.

She just reactivated it after about 8-10 days ""off."" We see that two of our very close friends (another husband and wife, let's say Susie and Kevin) are no longer her friend on there. They don't show up in ""mutual"" when I look at her friends - nothing. She **definitely** did not unfriend them, we know that for a fact. 

Today Kevin, who also works with me, implied that my wife had unfriended and blocked them both. Nope, I told him, she just had her shit turned off for about a week or so. Well, fact - she was not friends with either him or Susie. (No idea if facebook would unfriend only some people during a deactivation, and if so, *those exact two people?*). It seems beyond coincidental. We find it hard to come to any other conclusion except that they must have both defriended her during the deactivation.

We presume that they both defriended her, but we can't prove this, and certainly wouldn't make the accusation. If they want to tell us that's what they did, fine. I don't really give a fuck about facebook, but I do very much give a fuck about people treating my wife fairly. 

Concurrent with all this, my wife sent Susie a text, and vice versa. Both show delivered on the other's phone, yet neither received the other's message. A double-drop, if you will. Between two iPhones.

Kevin seems to be certain that my wife blocked them both, and that she was intentionally not responding to text messages. He thinks that Apple's ""Delivered"" notification is gospel.

I replied that I knew for certain my wife didn't block them, and explained her account deactivation, and that I didn't know what was up with the texts, but I'm sure a hug-fest could sort it out. He replied that Susie had a lot of pride and ""wouldn't be the first one to the peace table."" 

I mean, wtf - isn't that *her* problem? Did I not explain myself/my wife's position? I feel like someone's facebook is their own and they can do what they want with it. He told me things like ""[my wife] should give a heads up if she's gonna do that [deactivate]."" and ""In the social media age, unfriending or blocking is like saying 'Fuck you' to someone's face.""

Maybe so (personally I disagree, it's fucking facebook), but regardless wouldn't some civil discussion amongst (presumably) close friends clear it right up, instead of this passive-agressive shit? I feel Susie is being extremely childish in this regard and that Kevin is foolish for supporting her.

70302,"AITA for installing cameras in my house A female colleague of my girlfriend was in a bad spot in February and we had an extra room in our home. It was supposed to be a short term, 3 month thing. We told her we had the intentions of putting cameras inside and outside the house since we own a lot of expensive things.

Fast foward 8 months she's still living with us and has gotten really comfortable. We went on vacation and came back to things missing in our house. $400 sunglasses were one of the big ones. There is an individual she brings over that I've personally caught stealing a pair of glasses I bought on another occasion. He said he was drunk and thought they were his. The funny thing is, those glasses were in my bedroom. Since we don't have any hard proof I decided to put up those cameras.

Today, she said she feels violated and I need to take the cameras down. The cameras are placed in the common areas (living room, kitchen) and in my office. I told her that it would be silly not to own these cameras and what if we get robbed, there needs to be something we can review.

I didn't think I needed to consult her considering the situation and it just felt like something we'd rather have than not have. It's been brought up in the past that we were going to install them, we didn't get around to doing so until now. Am I the asshole?

Update: she went on a rampage and has been arguing about how we think she's a thief.  She's moving out end of the month.  All worked itself out.  Thanks for everyone's input.

Update #2: the conversations have gone to a whole new level of crazy.  She's claiming I'm trying to record her naked around the house.  I asked what are you doing naked around the house with housemates?  She stormed out today shouting i should put cameras in her room and bathroom.  I have no idea how this is getting so out of hand.  Wish me luck, this is going to be a long 2 weeks until she is gone.  Starting to really worry about her mental issues and the rest of the time she is here.

Final Update: My SO served her with a notice to vacate by the end of the month and it exploded into a huge argument that I able to witness from my newly installed cameras :D.  She packed her stuff this morning and left.  I'm extremely happy that is all over. I appreciate everyone's input and advice.  It all helped out greatly.",

When Jim (38yo M, changed name cause anonymous) saw me eating the sandwich he got annoyed and complained because I didn't offer him one. He's mentioned this a couple times before when I've quickly made something to eat. On one hand I understand because some days he will plan something he's going to make and ask us if we want a plate. However, he never says yes if I do ask him (not a sandwich person) and I didn't feel like I was personally attacking anyone for just making myself some food. Safe to say he was annoyed. It almost feels like I've signed a contract since I eat his food when he offers, I have to offer every time I make food for myself. I would not be upset in the slightest if he made food for himself.

31464,"AITA for sending someone a message to make them feel better? This just happened and I'm really upset by it.

There's an artist whose work I really admire. Unfortunately there's a group of people who don't like them. They get tons of hate on social media despite not having done anything wrong.

Seeing some of the hateful, threatening messages that they get makes me feel awful. I wish I could make these people stop but that's not possible. So I thought, if I was in that situation, constantly getting hate and negativity all the time, that would be incredibly hard. It would mean a lot to me to know I'm not alone and that people see what's going on and that they care and listen and believe me. 

So I decided to send the person a message. That was a big deal for me because I have social anxiety and negative reactions tend to make me feel completely worthless, so I find it very hard to talk to people on social media or in real life. Especially artists/creators that I look up to.

In the message I basically said to the person that they are important, that people care about them, that their art is amazing and that they are not alone in this situation. I explained that I didn't know how to help them so I wanted to at least send them a positive message since they get so many negative ones all the time. I said that I'd try to maybe send messages like this occasionally unless they post that that would just be annoying because I wouldn't want that of course. All I wanted was to show my support for this person who is going through something really difficult and awful. 

Unfortunately the person didn't take my message the way I intended at all. They replied to it - publicly - basically saying that they or their self esteem aren't the problem, that the abusers are the problem. That only the abusers can fix the problem. That I am silencing them and their feelings. Drowning out their words about the things that are happening. It was a pretty long reply that has since been deleted so I can't read it again. It was entirely negative and aggressive though. 

I never wanted to hurt this person more. Like I said, I only wanted them to find some friendly words among all the hate. I didn't say they are the problem in any way or any of the things that they claimed. I didn't say that they shouldn't be hurt by the awful things that people say. I don't understand how I silenced them by saying that there are people who care about them and believe them. 

I'm not angry at the person for having a negative reaction. I'm angry at myself because I genuinely thought I was saying kind things. I understand that maybe these aren't things that were important for THEM to hear so I completely get that they didn't like it and that's fine. But the public reply was brutal and really hurtful and I don't understand what I did that was THAT awful. 

I hate myself for sending that message now and I'm completely confused. Was it wrong of me to message them at all? Am I the asshole here?",

Before I hired the photographer, I had a meeting with her and told her that there were certain parts of my body I was very insecure about, and being plus sized, I needed a photographer who could accommodate that. She quickly told me that since she is also plus-sized, she was great at angles and editing that would flatter or hide the areas I was insecure about. I was so relieved, because I loved her work. We hired her the same day.   


We paid our photographer for 6 hours which included get ready, first look, ceremony, traditional, and dinner pictures which just included a toast and cake cutting. Our contract stated that our package included 300 edited images. It also states that the photos will be delivered within two months, but she has up to 90 days to deliver.  Totally fine. My only request was for ONE image that wasn't watermarked so we could send out announcements. She happily agreed.   


When we booked her for our wedding, our package also included an engagement shoot. It was beautiful. The pics were delivered later than the stated time in the contract, but at this point they were so beautiful, I didn't care. I loved them so much, I booked her for our Christmas photos. She sent me a couple of photos with no watermark so I could send out Christmas cards, but I didn't get our album of 40 photos until February.  I was pretty upset about it, but at that point, I had already paid her in full for our whole wedding.

Several of which were the same photo, just one in color, and one in black in white. If you include the sneaks which I don't have yet, I've received about 160 photos. And they are not good AT ALL. They are horribly unflattering, crooked, off centered, and she didn't even edit out things like a pimple on my husband's face. Very basic things. Some of them are so unflattering, I don't even feel comfortable showing other people. They're so bad they brought me to tears.

I couldn't hear my music because of theirs, I couldn't even hear the t.v. in the living room (with all the windows shut) over it. This went on for **9 HOURS!** At around 8.30pm, 2 of my kids were trying to get to sleep, and I thought ""enough is enough"" I took a sip of dutch courage, spoke to my next door neighbours at either side and rang my mum and asked her to come with me. I called round at the house (mum stood at the gate)... I went into the garden, front door was ajar and back door was wide open (nobody there but I didn't burgle them).

I went round the back and was faced with a banner declaring ""Clashtonbury"" along with around 50 people in ""festival"" gear (wellies, rubber ""flamingo"" rings, hula skirts, giant silly hats etc.) There was a lady bending over a stereo system with speakers pointing down the garden towards our houses, putting the next ""bass"" song on...

""Hi, I don't mean to sound horrible but please can you turn your speaker towards your house so it doesn't echo down the row?"" I said, (I was now speaking to the lady who lives in the house). At this point (an obviously obliterated) blonde lady (who didn't live there) wobbled over and said ""who's she? what does she want? who are you? what the eff do you want?"" I asked again if they'd turn the speaker towards the house so the ""music"" was at least a little bit muted and explained about the kids going to bed, ""*blonde*"" said... ""**It's not even dark yet, so turning the speakers towards the house won't make any difference!**""... not sure what difference the lack of darkness made to the volume of the music :/ Council Estate mentality! The music only got quieter after 10 p.m. The kids eventually got to sleep. People should be able to enjoy their gardens, YES! to the the detriment of neighbours enjoying their garden? NO! If you want to experience a festival, go to a festival!!! There's one 10 miles up the road in 3 weeks!

I was running around the kitchen like crazy but he was paused and completely mesmerized by the TV my dad was watching in the living room.

There have been multiple dates in the past where we've gone to restaurants with TVs and I have been ignored the entire meal because he's too caught up and can't look away. Even if it's sports (which he doesn't like) or a Spanish sitcom (he doesn't speak Spanish) anything on a screen will distract him. So I'm trying to cook dinner and get stuff done and he's just paused standing there watching a stupid show. I asked him (snappily, I will admit I was very frustrated because of multiple things at that moment) to please stop watching TV and set the stuff up (it was in his hands) and he yelled at me that I was being controlling. Now we're arguing about it again for the millionth time and his excuse is he didn't grow up in a house where the TV was always playing and he had to sneak out of his room to watch it whereas the TV is always on here and I had my own TV since I was little.

28989,"AITA for saying that I don’t get turned on by pictures of vaginas when my S/O sent nudes of only her vagina to me. There is a very clear distinction that I would like to make here that I told her I don’t like pictures of just vaginas. If her face is in it or she’s touching it or in porn if it’s being used I love that stuff. But just a picture of a vagina doesn’t do it for me.

I told her this preference so I didn’t have to lie an seem insincere and I felt she should know what drives me sexually, but after this she became super insecure accusing me of not liking her vagina specifically.

She said that it would be like her saying she didn’t like my dick and I responded it’s like me sending a flaccid dick pic. It doesn’t mean anything, it’s not in motion so to speak. If I sent her a picture of me hard that’s in motion that says I’m aroused and I feel good about you and myself. A flaccid dick pic is just borderline nasty as is just a vagina shot. 

Ultimately I didn’t want to lie to her and say that I was aroused when I wasn’t. I don’t know what I can do at this point because she now feels really self conscious about it. Was I the asshole for not lying to her and should I have lied to make her feel better? That’s what I’m leaning toward, but I can’t take back what I said.

As the argument dies down my brother starts to leave but before he does he says that he's going to have to sell his ps4 again and buy a new wifi motum so he, himself, can use it since no one else wants to help out the house. And that made me angry.

Am I the asshole in this situation?

Edit 1: so it seems I wasn't as clear as I thought I was so here is round 2.

 The full WiFi bill is 108. It was normally paid by my brother and his girlfriend on top of their personal dues and the house's light but he was recently fired from his job. My share is rent, and my personal dues due to the fact that I am getting paid far less than those two combined. When I can spare it I do help with everything else and normally I would say yes to helping with a bill that isn't mine but at this time I only have 80$ for the next 2 weeks and the 200 is for the bills. The delimma is, 150 of that 200 might in fact not be needed but I don't want to take any chances and be late on the rent by a month.",
34592,"WIBTA if I actively and vocally opposed my GF’s son from getting married TL;DR GF’s son is 19 and has knocked a girl up. Now the baby momma and her mother are pressuring him to get married. His mother and I on the other hand are encouraging him to have a paternity test and refuse a marriage while he is living in our home because their typical living arrangements haven’t been stable.

Backstory... GF’s son (19) had a long distance relationship with a girl. She moved closer and he quickly got her pregnant. Questionably quickly. His mother and I have encouraged him to get a DNA test. We both believe it’s reasonable no matter the circumstances to be sure. Even if it was possible for us we would do the same so there are no potential uncertainties.

That however isn’t the problem. The issue is he wants to marry this girl to appease her and her mother. Meanwhile he’s informing us of this as he is staying at our home because the relationship has been incredibly rocky. He has been staying with us for two and a half weeks out of the last three weeks because the relationship is so rocky.

I am incredibly opposed to this potential marriage while my gf is biting her tongue even though it’s her son. She doesn’t disagree she just doesn’t think she can be decent about it. He also informed us tonight his baby mama would be visiting in the morning and told me specifically to talk to the baby mama.

This is where I’m conflicted. I know 100% I am not wrong in some aspects of this but it is also entirely not my place. Not even slightly. I am nothing to my GF’s son or the woman he (potentially) got pregnant. It truly isn’t my place however I care entirely about the success of this 19 yr old kid simply because he is my GF’s son. Would I be an asshole for voicing my opposition to a marriage in a few hours when I have to look at the baby mama in a few hours?",
13209,"AITA For Wanting my GF to Get a Career? I'm M22, she's F22. My gf graduated last june with a BA in English Lit and hasn't been able to find a job. She works at starbucks and has no plans of going back to school or doing professional development courses in order to get a career. She makes around like 20-25k at starbucks, and I'm on track to make 75k this year. I live alone in my own place and she lives with her parents and pays no rent which is why she's able to survive on 20k. Last night I told her about a project management program and a HR program at a community college here in Toronto and explained to her how those fields lead to some decent paying jobs especially project mgmt if you get the certification. She said she doesn't want to go back to school and doesn't want to work in a ""business"" environment. I kinda snapped at her and said she needs to be proactive and better herself or else she'll be at starbucks forever. She got mad at this and said I'm an asshole.

39822,"AITA for embarrassing my boyfriend at work? Yes. Throwaway. We all know the drill. 
FaceTimed my bf yesterday while we were both on lunch at work. He works in a hospital and I work in an office. It should also be noted that said hospital is in an extremely rural area, and there are not many staff members nor patients. 
Anyway, I was alone in the break room, as was he. He spoke to nobody else during the call or even acknowledged anybody else during the call. I think we’re all guilty of talking to our SOs in private a little differently than we would in front of other people. Not necessarily dirty, but more along the lines of saying silly things, using dumb made up words the two of you frequently use together, saying some things in a “baby” voice (i frequently talk to him this way, as he does me. He actually did it for a good couple weeks when we started dating before I did it back) Most of our conversation he was a complete dick to me. He acted like he had better things to do than be talking to me, so I asked several times what was wrong, and each time he said nothing. 
Lunch comes to an end so I proceed to say goodbye and get ready to hang up. I get a “talk to you later, bye”. No “I love you, have a good day”, nothing. 
Receive a text from him and he is clearly aggravated at me, because of the way I talked to him. Apparently there were a couple other colleagues around him, and he said I embarrassed him, he was mad at me for it, etc. He said I should have known he was not alone. 
I don’t see it that way. I think he could have let me know he wasn’t by himself instead of having a 30 minute private conversation in the middle of an occupied lunch area. If he didn’t want to blatantly say “hey, there’s other people in here”, he could’ve simply said hi to a coworker, asked how they were, nodded at them, waved, something, ANYTHING to let me know they were there. I would have gotten the hint. Nope. He continued to let me go on like an idiot and bitch at me about it later. We are still arguing about this today. 
If IATA, I accept that. I would just like some outside perspective on this. So, AITA in this situation?",
96143,"AITA for asking my dad if he has a backup plan regarding the coronavirus and my grandparents returning from China My grandparents are Chinese. EDIT: They were in Zhongshan. They are flying back now. I asked my dad if he had a plan in place in case they had the virus, and raised the possibility of us getting sick. I stressed that I agreed with them coming back, but that I also wanted to know if they had a plan or any way to prevent the possibility of the rest of us getting sick.

He ended up saying, ""think about someone other than yourself"". I was fucking incensed, as I was asking out of care for others. I don't want my grandparents to stay in China, but I also want my mom and brothers and dad to stay safe. All I did was ask if they had a plan in place. They didn't, and just said wash your hands and if one of them is sick we'll all go get checked out. It escalated into a screaming match, with my parents telling me to think about my grandparents and how scared they are. I don't disagree with bringing them back at all, and told them that.
But all I fucking did was ask about a very real possibility of us getting sick, and if they had any proactive measures in place. I do care about my grandparents a huge amount. But I also care about the rest of the family, and I just want to fucking know if he has a plan. That doesn't make me fucking evil or anything, does it? AITA?",
72542,"AITA for yelling at my mate on his birthday night out? Like feel like I’m in the right, but my mate normally has a really good moral compass, so I don’t know.

It wasn’t actually his birthday but it was the night we celebrated. Me Bill and Phill went to spoons (a pub) for shots and then went clubbing. After we were done we walked around looking for a taxi.  We talked a lot on the way. One of the topics that came up was my sexuality (I’m bi). Phill mention how he finds gay sex disgusting and cringes when he says it. This was not the first time he’s said something like this and tbh I’d had enough. So I started shouting at his about how he’s being homophobic and insensitive. He simply says he’s not and I’m acting weird. So I continue shouting saying something like “how do you think it feels knowing that if I date another man and want to have sex my best friend is going to think I’m disgusting. And went someone is being a dick or something bad happens how do you think I feel when you describe them as gay!” 
This was followed by silence. After a min Phill says “I can’t believe that’s how feel. That makes no sense to me” it was obvious he was a little pissed with me. I dropped it after that.

So AITA for yelling at my friend on his night out?

Edit: need to explain something which I completely forgot.
Due to completely unrelated reasons I wasn’t drinking much that night. And I had need sober for a while.  Phil was a little bit tipsy but its hard to tell with him since he’s a light weight. 
I’m not sure if it matters but Bill was also sober at this point.

Also, although this doesn’t make a difference I thought I’d clarify; we were walking round town look for a taxi cos we kinda wanted to stay in town but we also kinda wanted to go to bed. So we walked around letting fate decide.

And thank you for everyone’s reply’s, it’s nice knowing that I may not have been completely in the wrong",
79251,"AITA for going after someone who's friends with someone who has feelings for me? so like sixth months ago i met this girl (i'm also a girl) and we would flirt with each other, cuddle, make out, but nothing more. i tried repeatedly to make us something more but was shot down every time, so i assumed she just wasn't into me. it had been awhile since we last made out and all we were doing was cuddling whenever we were at my other friend's house. and through this girl, i met this guy. long story short, this guy and i become an item. a few days ago i was at this guy's house and the girl snapchatted me and without thinking about it i just replied with a pic of the guy and he cuddling and she FLIPPED OUT. in hindsight, i shouldn't have done that, but i genuinely thought she wasn't into me; i was wrong. she starts going on about how i used her as a lesbian experiment and how i was acting like a ""straight girl"" because i told her i questioned my sexuality a lot and wasn't always sure i was into guys, coming to terms with my sexuality has ALWAYS been a huge struggle for me and having her accuse me of being straight really stung. then she starts snapping the guy i'm with talking about how i used her, how i dick hop to whoever's around, and telling him i question my sexuality a lot. while she's doing this, i'm apologizing profusely because i really do care about her and never wanted to hurt her because she's one of my best friends and i love her. i'm trying to tell her i never used her and that i didn't think she was into me because nothing happened more with us. she ended up blocking me on everything, my friend group is telling me that she just needs some time to get over it and that she'll come around eventually and i really do hope that's true because i love her, but at the same time i feel absolutely awful for what i did and for hurting her. so, AITA? or was it just a genuine mistake on my part?",
31748,"AITA for butting into my bro & his gf's argument and making it worse? My bro & his gf just had a full on heated argument over the fact that he's apparently been lazy in putting the toilet seat down, & that she's had to do it the last few times & it's TOTALLY disgusting (she's a real delicate flower, mind you she doesn't even fudging live with my bro).

So after a few mins of her verbally abusing him & explaining hygiene to him like he's 5, I cannot help but chime in.

Me: Do you lift the seat back up for him after you pee?

The room goes silent, my bro face palms, & she kind of just sits there staring at me with blank eyes. I could tell she was fuming.

She replies: Not that it's any of your business but no, why would I? He's the man, its his job. 

OOFF. I look at my bro in disgust, he shakes his head, eyes to the floor. At this stage he knows shit's about to go down & he's absolutely dreading it. 

Just a bit of background b4 I continue. I am 28f. My brother's 21, his gf 24 (she holds this age difference over him like she's royalty, pretty much always telling him what to do/how to do it). They've been together for almost a year now. 

I finally release the tension in my clenched fists & respond - the exchange went down something like this:

Me: Why is it a mans job only to put the seat down/up? Do your arms not work properly?

Her: It's common courtesy and the gentlemanly thing to do. I don't get why it's an issue, you're a girl you should be on my side?

Me: So women don't need to be courteous then? 

Her: (Clearly pissed off) I didn't say that, I just mean out of respect men should put the seat back down, we shouldn't have to do it...

Me: So you're saying that it's OK for men to touch the seat when they have to pee, but its totally unacceptable/a sign of disrespect if women have to touch it to put it back down?

By now it looks like she's about to massacre the place. She looks over at my bro with crazy eyes, to which he responds by telling me to stfu & leave it. Yup, probs what I should've done. But he's my bro, & this entitled idiot was constantly bossing him around & treating him like shit. I was mad. 

So after he told me to stfu, I told him that I'd stfu once his testes had been returned safely to their rightful owner. This did NOT go down well. He tells me to get out (fair enough). She's now screaming at him, telling him he has no respect for her, and that he's a pussy that let's his bitch big sister walk all over him. He apologises profusely, telling her he loves her, begging her to just ignore me.

Meanwhile I'm in the background making whip noises at him whilst gathering my things to leave.

I called my brother when I got home to say sorry cos I genuinely felt bad, but he ignored it & responded with a rather colourful text telling me to shove it.

Probably shouldn't have stuck my nose in, and am most likely the asshole, but this was 1 event of many others where she has verbally abused him for dumb reasons. NO RAGRETS.",

53750,"AITA for calling her out on a false claim of sexist behaviour? This morning I was having a work related conversation with some of my male colleagues in the office. We were mid discussion when one of our female colleagues comes over and openly asks our group for help with an unrelated issue, she did not ask anyone specifically.

As we were midway through discussing our plan of action in resolving the issue we carried on but made a clear change in tone to signify we were wrapping up the conversation but we did not acknowledge her directly. 

She waited all of 5 seconds and then blew up, claiming she was being ignored for being a women and we were sexist pigs and that we would be reported to HR. We obviously stopped our conversation and I responded it had nothing to do with gender and she should not falsely acuse other of sexism behayvior. In fact she was being rude for interrupting what was clearly an important matter to ask for help with an unrelated and frankly unimportant matter, and was not even prepared to wait until we had finished.

She gave us an angry look and stormed off. My colleague and I have written statements on the proceedings in the event she reports us to HR and we need to defend our behaviour.

For reference, she is from a completely different department and her matter was relating to her role and is not connected with ours at all.

AITA for calling her out on a false claim of sexist behaviour?",
38095,"AITA for not wanting to go with my mother's attempt at playing doctor? Hello folks,

I'm a about-to-graduate physical therapy student living in South East Asia.

My mother was a public health professional; in my country this means that she does not have a license to practice medicine. From what I know of her, she is severely lacking in basic anatomy and other knowledge that is required for a clinician.

After I started studying physical therapy in the Netherlands, she suddenly got it into her head that once I finish studying I can just go back and teach people into physical therapists - experience be damned. So after I returned home to start my internship for my last year, she was recruiting medical students of completely unrelated fields to work for her with dirt cheap salary and expecting me to train them into physical therapists. She bought various machines - some with actual health benefits, some completely untested - and thinks that it makes her a doctor. One time she told a friend to get off hypertension and diabetes meds right in front of my face! My father, who is a retired cardiologist, had an argument with her that day because he, like I, saw her advice as foolish. Naturally she ignored it and continued to tell people that diet and her machines can completely replace medications.

Right now she is hell bent on trying to get me to train completely unqualified people into physical therapists. I do not think I am cut out for teaching, and I do not want to work in an environment where I am forced to teach a medical profession in the absence of people with actual skills (she did not want to hire actual physical therapists). Our relationship has been tense since then.

Here, malpractice is punishable by jail and a large fine. I do not want to be there when the fallout of her trying to play doctor happens and she is saddled with a fine - or worse, landed herself in jail for crippling/killing a patient.

Am I the asshole for refusing to play along with her attempt to play doctor?  

Edit to add situation: I am currently living at home and spending my days alternating between working at a private hospital for training my skills and at her office. She was pressuring (more like guilt tripping now that I think about it) me into doing it because she wanted me to do something useful to her - and she has a dream of making a retirement house of sorts. But health care personnel is short in our country, so her solution to that was... to make her own school instead of just pointing prospective students in the direction of an existing university/college that is already teaching physical therapy.",
