&#x200B;

Today she sent me, my mom, and my dad a pdf of a letter from some of her old professors saying that they reject the ""disinvitation"" of a speaker to the graduating class of the English Lit/Social Science program. Her email only said ""I'm so fed up of this shit. This is such bullshit. I wrote back to the professors giving them my support over this crap"".

&#x200B;

I replied with ""Why are you so upset? How does this affect you? Do you even know who the speaker is? Or what they wrote about? It sounds like you want to be upset by something""

&#x200B;

She wrote back that I was being an asshole and that she didn't ""know anything about the guy, but my professor said he isn't sexist or homophobic"". I did some research on my own and found a recent interview he gave where he said that women are obviously ill-suited to leadership or science-heavy roles and that gay men/lesbians are ""shameful"". 

&#x200B;

So I replied, sent her the link to the interview and said ""this is why people are upset. You got immediately emotionally invested and worked up, and even wrote back to your prof, with literally 0 knowledge on the subject. You didn't bother to even google the guy/issue and see what the controversy was, just formed an opinion because someone told you to"".

&#x200B;

She got really upset and demanded that I apologize to her for being aggressive and rude. I refused and said that I wasn't sorry for telling her to do her own research on a topic before getting upset and engage in some critical thought.

&#x200B;

Now she and both my parents are upset saying that I went over the line, that I should apologize, and that I should reflect on how I speak to family.

&#x200B;

I tried to be as comprehensive here, but let me know if you have any questions/need more info.

So, AITA?

Me:Why are you so upset and fed up? Who cares? How does this affect you in any way?

Do you even know who this person is? Or what they wrote about? It sounds like you want to get upset by something

Her: You don't need to be such an asshole. Im upset because I come from the humanities and it makes me upset that people are silenced when their opinions are different.

I don't know anything about him, but from what my professor said, this man isn’t sexist and he disagrees with the decision to disinvite him.

And this does affect future generations. I don’t want the universities to become a place where people are silenced because their options are different.

Her: You don’t even know what I said to the professor [my name]. Anyway, clearly we can’t have discussions about this.

I didn't see her for the rest of the night until the very end when we were all going home or to our after prom plans. She also refused to do the couple's dance with me. 


So I was sitting in the lobby waiting for my ride when she came over to me. She didn't seem to think anything was wrong with what she did, but I was livid. I'm telling you right now, I was so mad I could barely speak to her. I didn't explain why at the time. She then went to the bathroom for a bit, but when she did, I just left and didn't say goodbye. Solely because I was feeling so hurt and I just needed to go. 


We didn't talk for a day. Then I texted her saying I was sorry for leaving without saying goodbye. She asked why I did that and I explained I was hurt and mad at her.

fast forward two weeks: on Monday (the banquet was that Friday) I got a call from my Dad, He was fishing in an annual ed fish tournament.

1513,1513,6ws7p6,1504022810.0,AITA for saying that the thought of having sex with another guy makes me uncomfortable? (Long),"Okay, so this happened yesterday evening at my local pub. It was a public holiday here in the U.K. and a lot of people were out for the evening, more than usual on a Monday night. One of those was an old schoolfriend whom I haven't seen for a good 4 years. We'll call him James. We were never especially close, but got on pretty well. It was nice to see him and catch up, and since leaving school and going off to uni has come out openly as gay.

We were chatting about a variety of things, and he was talking about the gay scene at his uni and how he came to terms with his homosexuality and stuff, and it was really great to talk to him about relationships and stuff and most importantly to see how happy he was - in his last year at school he went through some personal issues, and while I'm not absolutely sure if it was anything to do with his sexuality, a lot of people even at the time suspected that was the case.

Both of us had had a few drinks, although he didn't seem openly drunk or anything. At one point he made a remark that it was a shame that I'm not gay because he gives really great head and thought I would enjoy it. I kind of laughed it off, it was fairly innocuous, plus I'd been talking to him about my girlfriend so he knew that I wasn't gay, though he may have wondered if I was bi. Evidently he was wondering, because he asked if I had ever considered experimenting with guys. My reply was that I had never given it any *serious* thought, mainly because the thought of actually being sexual with another guy makes me feel uncomfortable.

His response was, ""Wow, that's pretty homophobic."" To which I explained that, to my knowledge of the term, I'm not homophobic, merely that I myself would almost certainly find no enjoyment or pleasure from experimenting with a guy. After, I could tell he had gone a bit cold towards me, and after a minute or so he made his excuses and went to join his friends. About ten minutes later, a girl whom I've never met before - let's call her Katie - came over to me and started berating me in the middle of the pub for being, in her own words, ""violently homophobic"" towards James. After effectively being shouted at for a good five minutes by Katie, with me trying to get a word in edgeways to explain why I didn't feel I'd been homophobic, the landlord of the pub came over and said that if the shouting didn't stop we'd both be thrown out. In the end, I finished my drink and a friend and I went somewhere down the road to get away from the glowering stares we were getting.

This morning, I sent James a message via Facebook and apologised for any confusion or offence caused, but he saw it and hasn't replied. Normally something like this wouldn't get to me so much, but I consider myself to be a very open, inclusive and accepting person of all sexualities, genders, orientations and the like. Hell, I pride myself on it. I don't feel like what I said was wrong, but from both James and Katie's reactions it's obvious that they took offence.

He moved before me and about two weeks after he moved, I came for a visit to bring the pets. In our new rental house, we don't have a driveway or parking, so we street park just like everyone else on this street. On the last day of my visit, my husband and I went out to eat and when we got back to the house, our neighbor came out of her house to inform us that we shouldn't be parking there (on the street in front of her house). She talked to us for about ten minutes about people parking there and having to get the cops involved and how she was mad about the way our rental was constructed, which has nothing to do with me or my husband. She finally stopped talking and we went inside with a funny story about our crazy neighbor.

That was about a month and a half ago, and now I'm living here. My husband started parking his car further down the street to avoid more interactions, but I recently purchased a car and there isn't room elsewhere to park, so I started parking there again. I'm not in the no parking zone, so I didn't see the problem. There's a clearly red-painted part of the curb, so I always make sure I'm not in the red, so to speak.

Today, our neighbor came pounding on our door to tell us that she's going to call the cops on us because of where we're parking, but she's trying to be a nice neighbor and ""tell us how to live in this neighborhood because I've been here for 66 years, this is just the way it is."" She also went on to say that she is unhappy that we have two dogs and she doesn't like where we put our trash bins. She continues to drone on with complaints and at one point says ""I could just call the cops, but I'm trying to be nice."" I got mad and said ""So call them."" To which she responded to my husband, ""And watch that, her mouth is going to get her into trouble one day."" Eventually we got her to leave.

After she left, my husband was kind of upset with me for how I responded, but I felt it was incredibly disrespectful of her to speak to us like that in our house. This is not someone who has earned my respected, so she doesn't deserve it. I'm not trying to cause problems, but I'm a firm believer in standing up for myself. So, am I the asshole?

On the last day of my visit, my husband and I went out to eat and when we got back to the house, our neighbor came out of her house to inform us that we shouldn't be parking there (on the street in front of her house). She talked to us for about ten minutes about people parking there and having to get the cops involved and how she was mad about the way our rental was constructed, which has nothing to do with me or my husband. She finally stopped talking and we went inside with a funny story about our crazy neighbor.

That was about a month and a half ago, and now I'm living here. My husband started parking his car further down the street to avoid more interactions, but I recently purchased a car and there isn't room elsewhere to park, so I started parking there again. I'm not in the no parking zone, so I didn't see the problem. There's a clearly red-painted part of the curb, so I always make sure I'm not in the red, so to speak.

Today, our neighbor came pounding on our door to tell us that she's going to call the cops on us because of where we're parking, but she's trying to be a nice neighbor and ""tell us how to live in this neighborhood because I've been here for 66 years, this is just the way it is."" She also went on to say that she is unhappy that we have two dogs and she doesn't like where we put our trash bins. She continues to drone on with complaints and at one point says ""I could just call the cops, but I'm trying to be nice."" I got mad and said ""So call them."" To which she responded to my husband, ""And watch that, her mouth is going to get her into trouble one day."" Eventually we got her to leave.

After she left, my husband was kind of upset with me for how I responded, but I felt it was incredibly disrespectful of her to speak to us like that in our house. This is not someone who has earned my respected, so she doesn't deserve it. I'm not trying to cause problems, but I'm a firm believer in standing up for myself. So, am I the asshole?

tldr: My neighbor kept threatening to call the cops on me because of my street parking despite the fact that it's legal. I told her to do it. AITA?",,

About two weeks ago, I decided to cut contact with my mom and sister, with low contact with my dad because for most of my teenage and adult life (I’m 28), they expect me to bend over backwards to do whatever they want for them while completely disregarding how I feel. If something is bothering them, it’s an end-of-the-world issue, and if literally the same thing is bothering me, “who cares it’s no big deal”. My whole beef with them is they come to me when they need me to do something to help, and promptly ignore me afterwards. I’ve had enough and I don’t want anything to do with them while this is the current status quo. 

That aside, I really love their dog. I took care of her from when she was a puppy until she was 4 when I no longer lived at their house. Unfortunately, knowing my mom, she’s not willing to spend hundreds of dollars boarding her when they leave for vacation and will most likely ask other family members to check in on her twice a day to feed/water her... which means she’s going to be left at home alone for three weeks.

Sometimes her tone wouldn't match her emotion, she would tell story's in a very disconnected and impersonal way, and she just couldn't take any level of criticism and didn't seem to be able to analyze her own behavior.

A couple years ago A met B through a work thing and they hit it off. B is significantly older than A. Their relationship progressed fast, A moved into his apartment after a month of dating. Because A and I are close friends she tells me a lot and I know that for the first six months of their relationship they were fucking like rabbits. That is, until B became super religious and told A that he wanted to wait until marriage to have sex again.

Understandably, this was a big problem for A. Ever since B made that decision there has been an almost unending stream of fights and tension. A and I live twelve hours away from each other so I don’t know B super well and really only know him through what A tells me (the times that I have met him, he seems like a sweet guy.) I have told her many times that their values don’t line up, and as B is getting more and more religious they are disagreeing on more and more big things.

Over the summer B proposes to A. A is over the moon excited, because getting married is something that she’s always wanted and starts thinking that now since they’re engaged that they can start having a physical relationship again. Nope, and B wants to put off the wedding. A tells me that since they got engaged that B has become even more distant physically.

My wife and I had a pretty middle-of-the-road wedding in terms of costs; it was definitely nice, but not a blowout or anything. My parents covered almost everything, as was their plan from the start. During the RSVP/invite window, my mom jokingly gave me shit for not putting up a registry yet-- we had honestly forgotten about it, because we weren't really in need of any gifts and didn't expect anyone to do so. She said people would probably feel awkward if they didn't get us *anything,* especially since she and my dad were covering every cost (including lodging), so my wife and I sat down to discuss it. We agreed we'd make an Amazon wishlist for some household stuff that we didn't have and kind of wanted, but that didn't end up amounting to much-- but what we *did* actually want was a little more wiggle room on our honeymoon. I want to be clear here: the trip was paid for already, from our own money, but it was that we had cut a lot of corners to fit it into our budget that gave us the idea for the fund. It made enough sense to us; instead of giving us things we don't need, if you feel compelled, you can donate a comparable dollar amount to this account that will be spent on padding out our dream trip as a couple.

We went through with it and added the option to our RSVP/general wedding info site. Again, to be clear here: there was *no* expectation of gifts in the first place, monetary or otherwise, which we even said on the site. Simply that if someone did feel the need to give us a gift, and nothing on the wishlist sounded good, this was another thing they could do.

The wedding came and went and it was genuinely beautiful, everyone had a wonderful time and I couldn't have asked for things to go any better. No one had said anything about the fund or the registry at all; a few things had been purchased from the wishlist and a few donations had been made (all of which we were deeply grateful for and were prepared to write the *shit* out of some thank you cards), but it wasn't a topic of conversation.

A few days later, though, we were shooting the shit with some extended family that had stayed on, and one of my aunts kind of blew up over the honeymoon fund. Ranting about how ""incredibly tacky"" it was and how embarrassed we should feel over even having it there, much less expecting anyone to donate. We were kind of blindsided already, and then a few cousins agreed that it was weird and kind of snobby of us, and that we should have just been ""normal"" and stuck to a physical registry even if we didn't need or want that stuff.

This isn't tearing our family apart and it's not that big a deal, but I'm really struggling to wrap my brain around it.

&#x200B;

I don't believe I have autism. I'm only diagnosed because during the assessment (which I went to because he wanted me to), he spoke for me, and told me he was going to ""bend the truth"" to assure the diagnosis.

He had also convinced me I had it at that point, because he was the only person helping me.

&#x200B;

After getting the diagnosis however, I realized... I don't click with it whatsoever! I've spoken with autistic people, their troubles seem completely different to mine, I don't meet much in the diagnostic criteria (and the things I do meet match with ADHD, which is a genuine problem and struggle for me... which I'll add barely gets any attention or treatment because everyone is pressing the autism issue). My Dad contacts every doctor he can that I have anything to do with to tell them not to listen to me, and fills them with the same lies and made up stories. I live in England and he's involved in the NHS, so it's hard to avoid since he knows who to contact, but I've managed to with my ADHD doctors who agree autism doesn't make any sense or fit, as well as an autism specialist I saved up for for two months to paid out of pocket to see JUST to prove to myself I'm not crazy (and with him, I pretended to suspect autism, I didn't mention any previous diagnosis or the situation).

  

I've thought about the idea that maybe I do have it and I'm just in denial, but any tests I take (AQ test for example < 10 points), I score incredibly low. I have no trouble socializing (growing up I was isolated, but that was due to my physical disorder and anxiety) when I'm treated for my ADHD - as the ADHD medication helps my anxiety AND depression too because I can actually do other things than sit there in a haze, which in turn makes me think less negative thoughts. I don't constantly misunderstand people. I don't do any of that!

I think it's because I don't like being around him, I don't want him in my life, he's a narcissistic control freak who doesn't listen. He gets his claws into everyone.

Of course my husband (who I had been dating for 10 years) waited till a week before and had his brother look it over. (His brother is historically terrible at giving advice). 

Let me just say that big moments are not my husband's thing. The first time he said ""I love you"" was over Facebook. He tried to rush our marriage proposal and there was a hired photographer in my face the whole time. Whom I thought was a very rude bystandard at the time. So I guess this proposal was so very much fitting of my husband. I'm pretty sure he gets it from his dad. (Who one family Christmas party got drunk and told his entire family how he used to bang his now wife who is basically the mother Mary of Catholics)

So big day and half a year of me and my mom planning. Had over 200 people mostly his ginormous and awesome family and children there (this is important). His family is way bigger than mine. And it has taken me years to get over my anxiety around them.

Everything is great except I can barely breathe because my seamstress made my dress to tight. (Went fuzzy when I first put it on) I say my vows which were really straight to the point but from the heart.

Husband starts off okay talking about how we met. Okay no biggie pretty normal. (Warning rated PG13) Then gets into his favorite stories **one of which** is how he one day came home work and saw me posing naked taking pictures of myself. (I am a hobby artist, so I use pictures of myself to get a pose and light right.

Needless to say I was mortified. My grandparents and parents were, of course, there along with about 20 children. I had decided that I would let absolutely **nothing** ruin my day that day so I just got past it and went to the next thing. The end of his vows were actually perfect and from the heart. The rest of the wedding went off without a hitch we both had a great time and I get lots of good comments to this day.

We were using budgeting software, and once or twice a month we would sit down and try and budget together. This would usually end in an argument about me trying to control where the money went, even though I was trying my hardest to get input from her. A typical comment would be ""why are you asking me, you'll just do what you want anyway"".

Skip to now, and because our youngest has started at daycare, she has been able to get part-time work. She has set up her own account and is keeping her money there where I can't see it, and doesn't think it's reasonable for me to want it in the joint account. My thinking is that with this extra income in the monthly budget, we can pay off our debts faster, or save up for a holiday etc but we should make the decision together. She wants to save it herself in a separate account so she can see the fruits of her labor (my wording). She says she won't be selfish with it but needs it to feel better about working and missing out on seeing the kids etc. 

Anyway I don't really know how other couples with families combine or separate their finances, so thought I'd see what Reddit thinks. ",,

It all seems so silly but I’m seriously on the verge of breaking up with my boyfriend of 5 months, “Carl”, over a stupid shush. 

So it all started when I was over at Carl’s apartment with about five of his friends. We just finished watching the spiderverse movie. The credits started rolling and I said something like “that was actually pretty good.” (I was a little skeptical of the idea of enjoying a superhero movie because i normally don’t like them). 

At that point, “Hank”, who is one of Carl’s friends, who in all honesty, I never cared for, shushed me. Like he literally shushed me and then said, “You’re gonna miss the post credit scene.” Keep in mind, that it was just credits at this point and I only said a single sentence. 

I think a grown adult shushing another grown adult is condescending and beyond rude. If he asked me to ""please be quiet, there's a post credit scene"", I would maybe have internally rolled my eyes but I definitely wouldn't have said anything. So I said with a pretty disgusted tone, “Did you seriously just shush me?” A couple of the guys laughed and did the “ooooooh she got you” thing. Hank’s face got red and he didn’t respond but was kind of cold to me when he left (after the incredibly important post credit scene).

I honestly didn’t think much of it but after everyone left, my boyfriend said that I shouldn’t have said anything and that if I had a problem, I should have come directly to him in private after the movie and that he would have told Hank. I told him this was ridiculous. This isn’t middle school. If I have a problem with the way someone’s acting, I can tell them myself and I don't need him to step in for me. He said I didn’t really care about the shushing, that I only wanted to embarrass Hank because I didn’t like him and told me that he doesn’t know if he wants to be with someone like that. That really set me off and we yelled at each other until I finally got the sense to leave and tell him that we’d talk later.

To this day, furries make me uncomfortable. I don’t have a problem with them, whatever you like is your business and I’m not one to judge, but everyone close to me knows it just bothers me and brings me back to those dark middle school days. (dramatic i know) I’d noticed a few things at first that got my radar going. The furry account searches on his instagram. I thought nothing of it at first, maybe he had a friend who was a furry, even I have one. But then i noticed some sexual pictures on his camera roll that really made me wonder what was going on. But I didn’t wanna think anything of it because we are very open about our sexual interests together so I thought he’d tell me about it if it was a thing. 

A month ago at a friend of ours party, I was talking to a friend of mine who used to date my boyfriend. She was asking how we were doing and the conversation was going fine until she said “I’ve always had the suspicion that he was maybe a furry.” I asked her what she meant and she said some of the stuff she saw him look at, but he never talked about it. 

I decided a few days after that party to ask him if he was interested in the furry fetish. I asked very calmly, I didn’t wanna seem like I was accusing him or being judge mental and he said he’d looked into it before and he wasn’t interested. I accepted that answer until a few days ago when he was showing me a picture on his phone and I noticed some rather explicit images of pokémon while he was scrolling (and scrolling fast might i add). 

I had to know, so i looked through his phone. He had a whole folder in his pictures of furry porn, he had been looking at accounts on instagram and ifunny. I’m not proud of doing that, but it was killing me because no matter how many times I brought it up, he denied any interest. 

I want to confront him about it. I’m not mad or anything, I’m just hurt he’d keep that from me. I may have had a bad experience with a furry but I love my boyfriend and if that’s something he’s into, id try to find a way to where I could be comfortable with it or at least try for him. 

I don’t want to upset him but I want to know what’s going on. So, wibta?

EDIT: For some clarification due to comments i’ve read, i’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 1/2 years. We are also VERY open sexually. I know what kind of porn he watches, we’ve talked about it. And a furry fetish would definitely not be his “weirdest” one. We do have an open phone policy but only with probable cause and I will admit it was dick move to go through his phone without the best reason. Also, a furry didn’t just creep me out in middle school, he said and did some very disgusting things to me that bother me to this day. I don’t want to get into too much detail about that. I did not go through his phone joust to find something to be angry about, I wanted to find some answers because I’m genuinely bewildered as to why this one thing is something he can’t tell. No my bf being a furry or liking it isn’t a dealbreaker for me, it’s about the fact that he didn’t tell me. He does know what happened to me with this incident in middle school, but I am not a judge-mental person so I’ve never said anything about hating furries or thinking they’re disgusting.
