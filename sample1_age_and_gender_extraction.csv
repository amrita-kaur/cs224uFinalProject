We only have ageeed on one rule that is that I don't bring any girls overnight without my sisters permission.(Which is crazy since we live in a big 3 bedroom apartment.) We both have our separate rooms and you don't get in the others way if you dont want to. I'm also in an Long Distance Relationship with my gf(25F), she lives about 2000km away from me.

&#x200B;

Now recently I joked with my girlfriend that I would be always able to figure out if she was up-to something in regards to coming back and surprising me. Well yesterday she did just that. She called me and surprised me completely by being in front of my door.

&#x200B;

My sister was home and my first reaction was to tell her that my gf surprised me and if you want to meet her, you have the chance. I didn't force her to do anything since she was in her home clothes and I know she doesn't like meeting people like that and I just let her know. I also told her 5 mins later that we will only be staying for an hour and taking the next train to my gf parents apartment. Now when I told this I noticed tears in her eyes so I went to talk to my gf and came back about 15 min later to find out what is going on.

&#x200B;

Well turns our she was super upset since my gf showed up because according to her we had a rule where we can't bring ANYONE from the opposite sex(my case female) without the others permission and I'm like wtf, I never agreed to this. She brings up stuff like how she hasn't liked any of my ex-gfs and that it will be the same now.I tried to calm her down and tell her to think and that it's nothing craxy, she came here FOR AN HOUR. Well she changes and just runs outside without looking at my gf. 

&#x200B;

I tell my girlfriend this and she is upset understandably as she had good intentions in mind and she calls an uber and within 30 min we leave.

&#x200B;

I call my mom and tell her the story, I said that I expect her to apologise to my gf and to me, because if she doesn't I'm not planning on living like that. My mom is like but she is your sister and family etc, to which I am but why should I put up with her if she is nasty to me and to people i care about.

&#x200B;

My sister sent an ""apology"" letter afterwards to me and my gf in which she basically states that it's basically my fault for not letting my gf know about the rule that I can't bring anyone over without my sisters permission, which is absurd and something I never agreed to.

&#x200B;

Right now it's been almost 24h and I'm just as pissed as i was yesterday when it happened. I'm seriously considering moving out now and just cutting ties with her.

&#x200B;

So AITA and WIBTA if I did this?

88181,88181,eh2htd,1577599671.0,AITA? Snapped at Friend Who Called My Kids Spoiled at Christmas,"DH(48) and I (44F) rented a cabin in the woods over Christmas for 10 days.  We invited friends FF(45) and MF (48) and their DS(14) and DS(19).  We have twins DS(10) &amp;amp; DD(10) and DS(4). And 3 cats. We’ve known them for years. The cabin is split in two living sections with a door between. 

First night was ok but FF seemed a bit grumpy.  The next day she barely spoke to us except for to say how loud and chaotic our side was (ha ha joke joke) and how she slept so badly. Night 2 &amp;amp; 3 still complaining re sleep.

Christmas morning we open gifts separately. We got our kids nice gifts but nothing crazy. They came in after gifts. FF looked around and said, wow you kids are spoiled.  Note: a month ago DD came home in tears when a kid called her spoiled so I knew this would be hurtful to her especially.

I looked up and said (maybe snapped?), “not spoiled.”.
FF yelled, “why do you always correct me? “. (I don’t recall ever correcting her!)  I replied, “no I’m sorry it’s just that DD had an issue about this at school and plus they aren’t spoiled.” FF repeated, “well I can say what I want and they are spoiled! Spoiled and lucky!” And stomped out. 

DS(10) came to me and asked what spoiled meant and i said it means rotten, like when a fruit or egg spoils, or when a kid gets too much stuff or their parents give them too much. I said, I think maybe she doesn’t know what it means. Suddenly she storms in (eavesdropping) and screamed,” you’re an effing liar!!  You told him I said he was rotten!” I told her he asked the meaning and I showed him the dictionary definitions on my phone. Edit: I did say both definitions but she only overheard the word “rotten” and extrapolated the rest. I edited this paragraph to reflect that. 

I went away from the kids outside and asked her to talk. She said she meant the kids were lucky and spoiled means lucky.  I said, do you know the definition of spoiled?  She didn’t answer so I repeated (later DH said this came across aggressive). Then I said this is obviously a misunderstanding and I’m sorry, next time I will talk to you in private. She lost her temper saying I embarrassed her and said I was basically a bully. I apologized again and said that if I ever do anything please tell me so I can fix it.  She couldn’t come up with any examples. Everything I said made her more and more mad. It came up that her sleep issue was because we were too loud.  I said next time tell us the first day and we can figure it out.  She said she did say so.  (Complaining about noise and sleep apparently meant it was us.)  I said sorry again and please just tell me things directly as I’m not good at reading between the lines.  We were really quiet the next two nights after this.  I actually didn’t know until then they could hear us - they are super quiet. 

The following two days she seemed somewhat better but grumpy.  I asked if I could give her a hug and she said maybe tomorrow. They left this morning 5 days early with no explanation. 

After discussing with DH I think I should have walked away and given her time and not pushed to resolve the conflict, but he and I don’t think it was wrong to say, “not spoiled” except maybe do it in private next time.  AITA?

INFO: DS got a fish tank, a small Star Wars drone and a lego set, DD got a karaoke party machine, small speaker, augmented reality recipe book, DS2 got DemoDuke and one of those tonka things you can sit and dig with outside.  Plus a couple of family board games for everyone.  Their sons got a bunch of clothes and the younger got a VR for his PlayStation.  I do know they are short on money this month but there wasn’t anything I thought was excessive or upset anyone.

INFO2: FF has been dating MF for 5 years.  Previously MF dated my sister for 4 years.  Didn’t want to mention that up front to not bias.  She said on this trip that she doesn’t trust me.

I'm (M28) part of group of friends, I gathered them all year after year (it sounds weird, like i'm à guru haha).

They are pretty much all my Best friend ( 4 guys).
One of them lived far away from us. After his break up with his girlfriend, he decided to live close to us. And He did. I helped him to find a place to live and a work (he make a bunch of money now, he's getting biger in his company.)

His Mother passed away When He was 13yo, so 
He's the kind of Man who suffers for being alone (I mean without GF). 

So He moved out, get on the internet and start looking for a GF.

He dated one girl, it didn't match. Then dated another one, bingo. He though it's THE ONE.

After weeks of relationship with the one, he introduced her to the group. All the guys in the group have GF. So the party was like boy side and girl side. We all tried to talk to her, trying to know her. But she was so freaking fake ! I mean, really fake. She was trying to be interested in everyone but it seemed hypocritical for everyone.

My friend is and handsome Man, he likes sport, he likes to partying. .. but no more nowaday.
Part aside, she's not pretty (physicaly meaning), I can't imagine why he dated this girl. 


Now, she's getting some shitty excuses for not coming to the party. Like ""i'm tired"" ""my stomach hurts"", etc... 


Ho, forgot to tell that They live together now. And They can't see each other in the week because she's an early worker, so she's getting to bed early.


Finaly the group has a growing hate against this girl, because she's chaging him not in the good way, and our boy for no taking action. 

I already told him by messages, and He answered me that he's happy right now in this situation. But he's barely seeing his friends anymore how Can He be happy ? Do We mean nothing to him ? 

I wanted to make the things clear, so We talked about it face to face. Just me and him. I told him everything that the group wanted him to hear.

He almost cry several times and told me that he can' t do anything, he's happy right now and that's it. She 'S not gonna work on herself to be accepted by the group.

I know, if he' S happy right now, there's nothing to do, let him alone. But nah, that girl is Just a pain in the ass, he Never Will admit it because he's afraid of lonelyness.

My husband (26 M) 's parents got a divorce when he was little and they both remarried to other people. He lived with his mom and occasionally visited his dad whenever it was convinient for my FIL. Needless to say, he saw his mom the villian and his dad as the saint.


I left my family after years of struggle and moved in with my now husband. We shortly married and found out I was expecting a month after the wedding. Our first child was thoroughly planned (ovulation kit, daily temperature check, preseed, etc) so it wasn't a surprise. 9 months later, my daughter was born. 

I tried to get MIL to like throughout the early part of our relationship. I visited her often by myself, cooked with her, went on walks, shopping, etc. She called me her daughter, etc. So when I was expecting, my husband and I announced. She was upset saying how she is not ready to be a grandma. She's now 47. She told me to get an abortion. 

We disagreed as the child was thoroughly planned and we already set aside a lot of money for her. 

I gave birth full term and my husband sent out a message to his father and his mother that I did. They both didn't reply. MIL came to visit a day later to see her grand daughter. Here is more drama.

1. She kept commenting on my belly for not going back and how I looked bloated. I just gave birth 24 hours ago.

2. She did not wash her hands to hold my daughter.

3. She did not ask me if she could take pictures of my daughter.

4. She reeked of perfume like she took a bath in it. 

WHO DOES THAT?

She later shared photos that she took of my daughter to people without letting us know. 

We got angry and she called us disrespectful and said all her friend's kids don't mind etc. I studied cyber security. I do not want pictures of my daughter on the internet. I explained that and she called me stupid and said it's her family and why should that be a problem. They are not her family or my husband's. She callS EVERYONE HER FAMILY.

Months later, we were hit by a hurricane, coincidentally on her birthday, and forgot to wish her a happy birthday. She came at me for it. Saying I made her son into a terrible human being (he left home at 17 due to abuse from her, I met him at 24). He always just sent her a e-card and that was it. 

She called me names and saying I'm broke her son with my influence and my background with my parents. How she has been a good grandmother to my daughter (at this point she has only seen her twice and never spoke to me about her).

I threatened to take all the evidence, email threats, to the police and told her I refuse to see her and that my daughter cannot see her either. My husband agrees with my decision. However, AITA here for not letting her toxicity be part of my child's life?



EDIT to answer some questions

I realized I made an age mistake, unfortunately I've let age get to me without realizing it did. I have edited the age.

Yes timeline is tricky, we married within the year we met. We planned for a child in that same year. This was because we are financially stable and the timing was perfect for paid maternity leave. In addition, we thought it would be best to child while we are younger in order to have more energy for our child and when we're both ready for a child. 

I apologize if it comes off as a validation post. Part of me is aware of this. I unfortunately from time to time wonder whether it was the right choice to no longer keep in touch of MIL and wanted to know what others thought.

To everyone that responded with something other than NTA, thank you. It really made me think from a different perspective. 

I saw that people made comments about perfume and washing hands, we have actually informed MIL of this in advance. She disregarded it. I apologize for not mentioning this. I totally support bacteria, however, it is crucial for under 3 months olds to not be exposed to too much because it could be life threatening.

I have been seeing a psychologist ever since my interaction with the MIL.

I told her I wasn’t changing it and she could call me by my born last name is she wanted.

My (26F) and boyfriend (27M) have been together for a couple of years and live in Canada. While I really enjoy traveling to foreign countries outside of North America, he prefers staying within North America. It's always been somewhat of an issue that I'd love to travel around with him but has never stopped me from going on my own trips with my friends.

For his birthday this year, I decided to suprise him with a trip to New Orleans, a place we've never been before and have always wanted to go. Better yet, a bunch of his friends also decided to join which I thought would be amazing. First time all of us going on a trip together and first time he will be going to the states with his friends which makes it even more special. This was decided about a week and a half ago. Keep in mind, I am also a student, working part-time and I am paying for both our flights, airbnb, probably our food for this trip. It's definitely a big deal financially.

Skip ahead to yesterday where his friend tells him that he is going on a business trip to Memphis Tennessee and how awesome it would be if he joined. This friend is also coming on our New Orleans trip. The hotel is paid for, he would just have to pay for his flight, food and activities. My boyfriend also expressed not being entirely sure as he is currently unemployed (seasonal construction work) and knows how expensive it will be with the conversion rate. 

My immediate reaction is that I couldn't believe this friend would even consider that after all the organization we've been putting into this other suprise. The whole part of the othe suprise is that his friends will be with us in the US and how special that will be since we've never all been on a trip together. I've been upset since I found out but have not voiced anything to my boyfriend yet because I really want to know whether my feelings are valid. Part of me also feels horrible for depriving him of this other trip but I feel he won't be as excited as he could've been for our trip together and may even worry about money while there if he does want to buy or do anything else.

So, AITA?

18583,18583,b0p8an,1552500786.0,AITA for wanting to move to a different state before having kids?,"So my fiancé (29M) and I (26F) have been dating for almost eight years. When I was 19 I moved out of my parents’ house on the West Coast of the US where I grew up, to the East Coast to be with him. Since then we have always talked about moving somewhere warmer because even though he grew up out here on the East Coast he says he is also tired of the long, cold winters. I never dealt with seasonal depression growing up since we barely had seasons (temps in the 50s were cold to me before moving here), but it was something I had to struggle to overcome after moving out here.

We both ideally would want to move back to my home state because we both love it (he has visited my family out there with me many many times) but the area I grew up in is rather expensive. We have both researched and discussed the possibility of moving to other areas/states as a compromise, as long as they are warmer than where we are now. I absolutely love the beach and the sun and the outdoors and miss it all the time.

He has about three more years at his job before he becomes vested with the state which would be smart to do for future retirement purposes. So I figured after he is vested we pack our bags and move like we have always wanted and then we start a family.

We have never really been ready for kids up until this point but now he is starting to get baby fever a little I guess. Last night I told him I am hesitant to have kids before we move because I am afraid it would lock us down to stay here long term and we have both said we don’t want that.

Having a kid complicates things and I would feel bad putting them into one school system just to pull them out, not to mention it changes the entire financial situation. He got mad at me and said I am withholding my eggs and using it as leverage and that I’m not thinking about a family with him for the right reasons.

16805,16805,ax0pv2,1551659660.0,AITA for crying when my mom made pork,"TL;DR: Pork is basically people and I leaked eye water when mom made an unseasoned pork after I asked her not to. Since people aren't reading the post: I'm happy to cook for myself and for them. I'm expected to eat with the family. I'm not incapable of feeding myself. 

Ok, this requires a little backstory. I(29F) live with my parents while I go to school full time to be an X-ray Technologist. Long story really short, my dad was diagnosed with cancer last year and my parents offered to pay for me to go back to school if I moved back home and kept an extra eye on dad. (I own a house in the midwest.)

I'm about a year into my RADT program and I've seen all sorts of really nasty stuff at clinical. Part of our program requires us to spend X amount of hours in the OR(operating room) working the C-arm. Now, to the pork thing. Ever since I started in OR I developed a severe aversion to the smell of unseasoned pork as it cooked. It might have something to do with the smell that comes from cauterizing.

I'm happy to cook meals for my parents, and I am a pretty good cook. But I've asked respectfully that if they plan on making pork meals, that they heavily season it(Garlic, herbs, bbq). Mom seemed a little taken aback and asked me why. I explained that it had to do with my experience in the OR and the smells. She seemed to understand and agreed she wouldn't make pork.

So 5:30 rolls around and no one has asked me to make dinner, and it doesn't seem dinner is in the works so I figured it was a 'fend for yourself' night. I come downstairs and am assaulted by the smell of boiling pork.

Me: ""So what are you making.""

Mom: ""a ham""

OK I'm panicking. She opens the lid of the \*slow cooker\* and I see something that vaguely resembles a pale ass cheek swimming in some tan liquid. I'm sweating from nausea. 5 minutes go by and dad comes up the stairs and says, ""Can you check to see if the veggies are done?"" (I get asked to do this a lot because my parents don't know what a cooked carrot is supposed to look like, I guess.)

I open the lid and I shit you not there is a pot full of pork stock filled with potatoes, carrots and greenbeans. Literally no seasoning. Just Pork Flavored Boiled Vegetables.

Is there no pork-free option? The finished ""ham"" literally looks like the inside of someone's ass cheek while they do a posterior hip replacement.

Voice shaking I say to dad(mom is downstairs) ""I can't eat this""

Dad, ""Why not?""

Me, ""I've explained that I can't do pork...""

Dad, ""When did you say that?

Me, ""Around the time I started OR -"" I'm starting to cry.

I am planning on addressing this this afternoon which is why I need help quickly, and If I am the asshole, I will need to take a different approach then I plan to now.

I recently met this person through a mutual friend. I am part of a local mental health group advocating for better provincial mental healthcare. One of the leaders of the group is a very close family friend of mine. I am an artist, and so this family friend let another person know I was, as they are writing a book and needed an artist to draw up a sketch for them. I added him on Facebook in order to do this.

I thought this person was a little older and had some experience and they had obviously struggled with mental health issues and they were coming out of it, hopeful and engaging in their passion and having an outlet. I felt for them and I understand that having gone through it, so I offered to do a sketch for free as it can count as volunteer work for me and show up in my portfolio.

He has absolutely no photos of himself on Facebook, so I have no idea what he looks like. Since meeting him he has been nonstop messaging me. After about 20 messages back and forth from the first ever message, he wanted to meet up. If I don’t reply fast, don’t want to call or am busy, he starts subtly guilt tripping me. I have no idea if he even knows he’s doing it. I asked him if he had the same diagnosis as I do as I used to be very similar to him when I was untreated, but he said no. He said he has anxiety, depression and tested high for PTSD. I suspected he may have BPD, as that is what I had/have (was dx'd at 16) however most of my symptoms are now invisible as I use skills and cope very well now, and only am really challenged in tough situations or actual trauma/crisis. He said he has looked into BPD/CPTSD however does not rank high on the list, which I have a hard time believing. I also asked him if he has seen a psychiatrist or therapist, and he sees a psychiatrist once a month, however he stopped taking his medication because he said he relies on them too much and they make him worse, that he's feeling better now that he is off of them. He said after he's been off of them he's attracted to that rollercoaster of emotions again. He says he's doing better and happier but then every few days says he feels like giving up, etc. He said he stopped living in (month) 2017, because of a loss he had. I sympathized for him in these past few weeks (mostly the first 1.5) and listened to his story and shared mine, which had some similarities. I think he thought this meant we were like fated to be or something. He has attempted suicide multiple times and failed, says the only language he spoke after the incident for a while was music, he dropped out in his senior year of high school and has not planned to go back yet,

He has been pressuring me into calling him as he describes himself as more of a ""voice person"". He has mentioned this and tried to get me to call him numerous times, always saying ""no pressure""! He sends multiple messages and/or almost every message is long and full of oversharing and trying to relate, saying things like ""I have anxiety too"", followed by oversharing. He apologizes a lot but it does not seem sincere, it seems more out of insecurity and trying to be ""nice"" and there’s constant guilt tripping if I don't reply much or quickly by saying things like,

• “i don’t mean to disturb you”

• “I don’t wanna bug you about anything”

• “if I’m bothering you and you’d rather me just leave you be just let me know. You could just tell me”

• “I don’t bite!”

• “have a good night. Sleep tight and sweet dreams”

• “I’ll just let you be” followed by a wall of text and “have a good day”.

• “It seems like you’re here one minute and gone the next”

• “how come you’re so against calling?”

He had a bad episode the other day and I barely replied to him that night, and the next morning he sent me 6 one minute voice messages letting me know it’s not scary for voice or to call him, and there was a lot of awkward laughing and saying things like “you really helped last night, even though you barely said much... you and x (person who I’m close family friends with) have a history of barely replying to texts \*awkward laugh\*” and “I know I said I would give you your space which I will, \*laugh\* so just reply when you’re ready” which he did not wait for my reply and later sent me a message that he found me on tinder (which I rarely go on)? He also kept mentioning how he’s not some big scary person, and how easygoing he is, how he’s a good talker and listener. He also said “I don’t wanna push any boundaries or anything obviously you have your own”. He’s been pushing my boundaries this whole time. “It feels like I’m talking to myself \*awkward laugh” like yeah, you are. It’s a one way voice message.

Another thing is that he tries to get me to talk about my personal issues. He also continuously offers for me to talk to him if I’m going through a hard time and says like if i ever am struggling and need someone he is always quick to rush to a persons side. Keep in mind I do not really know this person and have literally only talked to him for 3 weeks tops. I have been in therapy for 2 years, rarely cry now and I like to deal with my issues on my own, and if I need help I can call my therapist, use skills or reach out to one of my longterm, trusted best friends. On one of the voice messages this guy said “I know this might sound strange but I’m willing to put my problems aside for now and try to help with yours” and “It would be really nice to hear from you tonight, Maybe you can talk to me a little more about what’s going on and I can lend a hand, but that’s totally up to you, i don’t wanna be invasive or anything like that”. He has been SO invasive. He also has said ""If you ever need anything while you're really bad, I'd love to be the one you call"". ""If anything is bothering you I'm all ears :)""

He also complained the other day because his ""inspirational videos"" that are sometimes like 20mins long don't get attention in the provincial group I mentioned, and said he goes through youtube to find the best ones but nobody seems to watch them. He then went on this self depreciating and then self motivating rant of sorts where he called himself a loser, said he hated wasting time and feeling like he was wasting away, how he's tired of everything being ignored and how he wants to help people because he knows what its like and doesn't want anyone to feel the same. I agreed but said theres not a lot one person can do, as a lot of it is in the hands of that persons loved ones and ultimately the government. I agreed there is a lot to be done (which is why we have the group advocating for better mental healthcare). He then said he will put his hands in and ""do it one way or another"" and said ""I will do more than I can do"". I agree people need help but I personally know I cannot save the world. I used to be like him when I was years younger and I wanted to help and listen to everyone, but I realize now that that was just me trying to ignore my own issues and help others so I felt I had worth. It was exhausting and way over my personal limits, so I do not do that anymore for anyone other than close friends and for others I help refer them to resources locally. He started arguing that these resources aren't there and that they don't work, etc. I know they need to be increased and upgraded but again, I am one person and cannot spend all my time fixing other people. Others need to advocate for themselves and push to get care for them or their family, I cannot do that for them but I can provide information to help. Again he went on like who cares? should it have to be like this? nobody cares about me other than a few close people/family + friends (isn't that what adulthood is?) , my story is a ruthless one, ""mock and laugh all you want I will find a way"". Afterwards he was like whatever forget about the drawing I'm not going to write the book, nobody understands me or my ideals, all they do is mock me, what difference can I really make?

After sharing his personal story he felt better and decided he did want to write the book again and wants my illustrative help. He said ""Hey, you still owe me a phone call. Don't think just because I told you my story you can escape. ������"". I just said I need to hear the plot idea for the book and he said ""I feel as if it's my only leverage ��""

He started texting me on my phone as well as messenger. He text me about how he's been betrayed by friends recently, saying one bad thing after another.

At this point only did he tell me his age, which I honestly should've suspected earlier based on maturity level. He followed it up with saying his age doesn't make his story less relavent, and how people say he's mature for his age and has a lot of understanding, etc. He was very defensive while saying these things even though my messages held no judgement so I simply said a few times to stop making assumptions. He then kept apologizing and saying he didn't mean to offend me. Said these things more than once. The next day at like 3:45am he sent me walls of texts saying how he's thinking about it a lot and hope that his age wont stop ""what we had going the other night"" referring to me listening to his story and sharing mine. Then said a lot of people chuck away the severity of his story because of his age and call it ""teenage drama"", and that he hopes his age doesn't influence how much I rely on him, which I do not, at all.

He also said ""he's weird"" and set out a goal to pursue becoming friends with me, and everyday he sets out to try not to be annoying and take baby steps into getting me to talk to him so I wouldn't be shy, and he knows thats not how it works but its worth a try. I am not shy at all, I just do not text a ton and do not know this guy. He also said he read my mental health resources album not only to ""prepare himself"" but to try help me if the time came along. He says again, trying things like the voice messages was another way he tried and that he feels like this is some sort of mission. He said he started losing faith that I would open up and talk to him and doesn't know why he felt it was so important but felt we had problem similarities and after hearing my story it turns out we did. He said he was shocked I opened up (I share my story with anyone who asks, I just haven't posted it publicly) and said he knows I only really have my close circle of friends that I trust and care about but that he would love to be a part of it and would love for me to be in his. His second last of text was just saying he felt it was important to tell me, have no idea where this is going, said he's just an average weird guy who cracks dumb jokes and likes to make people laugh. The last one he just said I will let you sleep, text me tomorrow if you want, calling me an inspiration in his life, sweet dreams and goodnight. He took 2 hours to type all of these walls of texts. I did not reply and later that day he sent a text around 7 pm saying he hope it wasn't weird, and then another around 11:30am saying sorry twice and have a good night. I said I ""forgot to respond"" and he said he figured it was something I would respond to, and to have a good one.

He has now randomly showed up in my city which is nearly 2 hours away from where he lives, which he said is to check up on our mutual friend as they have had some life things come up recently. Since he arrived he has been pressuring me about it and going again with the ""I don't want to bother you"" ""no pressure"" and wants to meet up. Every day since he has been here he has been checking in about it. He has been complaining a lot because where he's staying has pets and he is very allergic. He is trying to get sympathy for it and I just sorry of asked if he has medication and can get out. Later that day he again talks more about how he's a giver and loves helping people in need and oversharing about his life.

I decided I may meet him today in the afternoon as its the only time I have available. I am going to do the drawing and then hopefully with some advice, set him straight and enforce my feelings and boundaries quite sternly and clearly, and say that I am not particularly interested in being friends or further contact unless he has finished the book and wants me to read it, and that I do want him to finish it for himself and also because of my effort. I feel that meeting him and giving him the drawing that I originally agreed to is the best way to sever ties.

Please help me in figuring out what to say / do in this scenario.

TL;DR : Close friend recommends me as an artist for a person writing a book, we are all part of a FB group advocating for better provincial mental healthcare. I add the person after they reach out and agree. They begin messaging me constantly, becoming very clingy and attached, guilt tripping, pressuring me to call them and meet up, complimenting themselves and saying how mature and understanding they are, trying to pressure me to reach out to them when I'm not doing well, saying it is their mission to become friends with me and have me open up to them, hating themselves, rollercoaster style emotions, baiting me for sympathy, acting like its fate we met, judging me based on replies/reply time, seemingly acting ""fake nice"" IMO due to clinginess insecurity and need for acceptance, randomly showing up in my city and wanting to meet up, etc. Need advice on how to address these issues.",False,not the asshole,3,35.0,0,"AITA for wanting nothing to do with this guy (18M) and wanting to sternly tell him to cut the shit + cut contact?

He didn't smoke when we first started dating, this started a couple of months ago before I found out I was pregnant.

Our daughter was born at 27 weeks so she is in the NICU with sensitive lungs (she's on a CPAP and high flow right now, she did have a breathing tube) and from the beginning they warned us about smoking.

We don't have enough to pay our rent and his mom was gracious enough to give us money for rent. I found out that he was spending that money on cigarettes behind my back. 

He claims that he's not addicted to nicotine and cigarettes but I think he is with everything he is doing. I feel that he should be more thoughtful of his children and stop the habit before it gets worse and he truly does become addicted, especially since this is something I didn't come into the relationship with and a habit that we frankly don't have the money for.

Around halfway through the night, she was dancing with her friend (Meg). I saw a bouncer approach Tara and Meg and told them to go with him.

I broke up with him because he wasn't handling his depression well and it was starting to trigger up my own issues. He started criticizing me, 
taking things out on me and I stopped seeing friends and going out because I spent so much time taking care of him. 

Even though I broke up with him, he took it much better than I did. When we met a week and a half later he told me he was relieved and he was doing so much better now. He implemented almost every suggestion I had made - from getting a therapist, to meditation, to taking walks in the morning... He even rearranged the apartment the way I'd wanted it for all these months. 
And no, he's not at all interested in getting back together. 

I, on the other hand, was sad but managing. It was a good relationship for a long while and I was sad to see it end. I told him I didn't want to be friends. He stays friends with all of his exes, but I'm not comfortable with that. 

The past two weeks he's been texting good (male) friends of mine and asking them to hang out. They all came to me first to ask and I don't know what to say. He has less friends than I do, a lot of his close friends are married with kids and don't have time. I have a big community that all lives in our neighborhood and organizes a lot of events together.

On one hand, I know he has less friends and may be lonelier than he's letting on post-breakup. I'm happy to see him reaching out and trying to make connections with people, because he usually isolates himself. 
And on the other hand, I made it clear that I don't want to be in each other's lives. I feel like it's weird, especially with the age gap, to try and cozy up to my good friends (he reached out to my roommate and two of my closest friends, it's not like mutual acquaintances)

I (25f) am an actress, and I recently booked a lead role at a substantially sized theatre in the city where my husband (30m) and I live. I have been struggling to get gigs, and so when we found this out we were both elated. He has always supported my dreams of becoming an actress, and due to the nature of his job I have been lucky enough to pursue this dream without us worrying about finances. He is the love of my life and I am so lucky to have him.

Two years ago, my best friend took his life. He was a stage manager, and we always talked about how we would move to New York and work on the same shows together. We had been friends since college, and we were each others favorite people. My husband and I met shortly after college, so they have known each other for some time and we've always all gotten along.-Side note, my best friend was gay, so there was never any kind of romantic jealousy-When he passed away, my husband was there for me every step of the way, and has been my rock through all of this.

When the time came to write a bio for the show (what shows I've been in before, college, etc.) I decided to dedicate my performance to my late best friend. I didn't even think about telling my husband, because I thought he knew how much it meant to me, and that it didn't change anything about our relationship.

However, on opening night, my husband was incredibly angry. He said that he was thrown off, and since I'm the lead, that it was embarrassing that there was another mans name in the first bio of the program. A bunch of our friends came to the show, and he said that it was embarrassing that he wasn't mentioned, after all he had done for me. I tried to explain to him about what my friend and I used to talk about all the time, but he wouldn't listen, saying he was too hurt to talk about it.

For a little bit of background info, last Christmas was the biggest soap opera Christmas Special ever. No, but in all seriousness, last Christmas was a genuine shitshow. My dad (45) has always been an extremely religious person, and since January 2018, there's been a lot of arguing between my parents, stuff that my brothers and sisters have all been involved in. The police have been called round 3 times, the most recent being in July of this year, and my dad was arrested. Back to Christmas 2018, my dad was FUMING because he thought my mum (45) had ruined Christmas. There was a big argument that evening, and my breathing started going funny. We'd been trying to get to my Grandmother's house, but dad was saying that nobody could leave until we sorted this out. We all got in the car anyway, but dad WOULD NOT STOP. I was crying at this point because I was so scared of him. I didn't know what he was going to do. In the end, mum decided to start driving anyway, at which point my dad opens the side door so it's up against a curve in the side of the wall in an attempt to physically stop us from leaving. This was the final push for 12 year old me, and I RAN OUT OF THE CAR, AND TOOK OFF. My mum yelled at me from down the road that if I didn't come back, she would call the police to come get me, and I said no. That's how scared I was.

After the trauma of last Christmas, and this Christmas less than a week away, I have decided I'm not celebrating it. I want nothing to do with it, but my one of my brothers and my two sisters are all saying I'm being ridiculous and stupid, and I'm going to regret avoiding Christmas. My argument is that seeing as all this arguing is still going on, I don't want to be taking any chances. They refuse to listen.
Religious dad is also not taking the hint (haven't told him, but it's obvious as fuck). I've moved my mini Christmas tree out of my room twice now, and he's forced me to put it back both times.

Am I the asshole? I'm not trying to ruin other people's Christmas, just not celebrating Christmas myself.

EDIT: Just wanted to say that my mum is amazing, and when I say she yelled, she only did this because it was Winter, which means ice, which means I could have injured myself, and the fact that it was pitch black outside, save for streetlights, which didn't really help with brightness.

Back to Christmas 2018, my dad was FUMING because he thought my mum (45) had ruined Christmas. There was a big argument that evening, and my breathing started going funny. We'd been trying to get to my Grandmother's house, but dad was saying that nobody could leave until we sorted this out. We all got in the car anyway, but dad WOULD NOT STOP. I was crying at this point because I was so scared of him. I didn't know what he was going to do. In the end, mum decided to start driving anyway, at which point my dad opens the side door so it's up against a curve in the side of the wall in an attempt to physically stop us from leaving. This was the final push for 12 year old me, and I RAN OUT OF THE CAR, AND TOOK OFF. My mum yelled at me from down the road that if I didn't come back, she would call the police to come get me, and I said no. That's how scared I was.

After the trauma of last Christmas, and this Christmas less than a week away, I have decided I'm not celebrating it. I want nothing to do with it, but my one of my brothers and my two sisters are all saying I'm being ridiculous and stupid, and I'm going to regret avoiding Christmas. My argument is that seeing as all this arguing is still going on, I don't want to be taking any chances. They refuse to listen.
Religious dad is also not taking the hint (haven't told him, but it's obvious as fuck). I've moved my mini Christmas tree out of my room twice now, and he's forced me to put it back both times.

Am I the asshole? I'm not trying to ruin other people's Christmas, just not celebrating Christmas myself.

EDIT: Just wanted to say that my mum is amazing, and when I say she yelled, she only did this because it was Winter, which means ice, which means I could have injured myself, and the fact that it was pitch black outside, save for streetlights, which didn't really help with brightness. She was trying to protect me, so please don't see that as anything else.",13.0,M

She’s also decided to stop going to family events because my grandma has a cat and she doesn’t want her daughter around one. She followed that up with “And no one will even miss us since “OP” is having a baby”. I’ve always blown her off as we don’t see one another frequently and it’s easier to keep the peace. 

I recently moved and my invite to the baby shower was sent to the wrong address. It wasn’t her fault, my other aunt was handling it and sent me a new one as soon as she realized.

Now, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. 
I'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. 

Well, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. 

We were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. 

He was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. 

He paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. 

I was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...


Well he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. 

Here's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. 

He promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. 

TL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just ""teenage boy syndrome"" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me.

The day I turned 18yo I moved away for a job I had lined up. A few months back I moved back to my home town after a little over a year of not seeing my family at all only phone calls with my mom and aunt. When I got back I reconnected with my family and some old friends. I was living with my mom again and staying 1 or 2 days a week at my aunts farm. My aunt has 4 grandkids she have custody of. 3 boys (17, 14, and 12yo) and 1 girl (12yo). I really enjoy spending time with all of them after such a long time not seeing them. I work A LOT and spend most my days off either at my aunts or at friends. Me and the 17yo was super close growing up and we reconnected very fast. We have became like best friends again, like when we was a bit younger. During this time I also realized that the 12yo girl is a lot like me. Her, the 17yo, and I started hanging out a lot at my aunts farm. It got to the point where she would follow us around when we fed the animals or ride the 4-wheelers and Dirt bikes, and I was fine with it because she was a cool little buddy to have around. I'm pretty sure she has some abandonment issues due to her parents running out on her when she was just born, so she is very clingy and literally wants me around her 24/7. She is also the type of kid that is very cuddly, while we watch YouTube or something on my phone she will lay her head on my shoulder, she will lay her feet across my lap while laying on the couch, she will try to sit on my lap and I normally tell her to get down because it just feels weird. You know that kinda stuff but she does it with pretty much every adult she is around.

Well last Sunday I was staying at my aunts and the 14yo and 12yo boys was gone to there real mothers house, it was just my aunt, the 17yo, her, and me. I get a phone call from my mother who tells me I need to leave because she thinks there is some inappropriate stuff going on between me and my cousin. I tell her there is nothing going on and how it is fucked up that my mother would even think something like that. I stay that night, but during the night i can hear my mom on the phone with my aunt. They are talking about me, and my mom is telling her the same thing she told me. The next morning my aunt is acting very weird every time I get near my 12yo cousin. She wouldn't let my cousin go anywhere on the farm with me or the 17yo cousin. My 17yo cousin says he is going to drive to McDonalds and grab us all something to eat. All 3 of us was watching a movie before he said he was going to leave to get food. So me and the 12yo was going to stay there and finish watching the movie. My aunt starts screaming at me about how I need to go with him and I can't be alone with 12yo cousin, telling me if I don't go with him I can just go home. My 12yo cousin was sitting next to me during this and started tearing up. It made me feel horrible and like I was a piece of shit for spending time with my cousins.

Well since that day I been ignoreing all my mother and aunts phone calls. Spending all my time at friends house except one day where i avoided going home for as long as I could then just went home didn't say anything and went to bed. I'm unbelievable hurt that my aunt and mother would think I would do something like this. I don't feel welcomed in my moms or aunts house any more. Now they are both confused texting me things like ""whats wrong, you aint' been acting like yourself"" They sent a text about what time Thanksgiving was and I sent one back saying "" idk if I'm coming yet"" and now they are pissed at me for not wanting to go. The only thing that makes me want to go is cousins. I don't want them to think I don't want to be around them anymore. But I can't bare to be in a room with my Mom or Aunt. I feel deeply hurt by them thinking I would ever do something like that, it makes it a lot worse by them acting like they don't know what is wrong with me. So I just been ignoring them and avoiding going around them.

I know it will hurt all 4 of my cousins feelings if I don't show up for Thanksgiving because I am the only other family they have beside my mom and dad.

I (19M) still havn't decided if I'm going to go to Thanksgiving tonight or not. So a bit of back story is this.

The day I turned 18yo I moved away for a job I had lined up. A few months back I moved back to my home town after a little over a year of not seeing my family at all only phone calls with my mom and aunt. When I got back I reconnected with my family and some old friends. I was living with my mom again and staying 1 or 2 days a week at my aunts farm. My aunt has 4 grandkids she have custody of. 3 boys (17, 14, and 12yo) and 1 girl (12yo). I really enjoy spending time with all of them after such a long time not seeing them. I work A LOT and spend most my days off either at my aunts or at friends. Me and the 17yo was super close growing up and we reconnected very fast. We have became like best friends again, like when we was a bit younger. During this time I also realized that the 12yo girl is a lot like me. Her, the 17yo, and I started hanging out a lot at my aunts farm. It got to the point where she would follow us around when we fed the animals or ride the 4-wheelers and Dirt bikes, and I was fine with it because she was a cool little buddy to have around. I'm pretty sure she has some abandonment issues due to her parents running out on her when she was just born, so she is very clingy and literally wants me around her 24/7. She is also the type of kid that is very cuddly, while we watch YouTube or something on my phone she will lay her head on my shoulder, she will lay her feet across my lap while laying on the couch, she will try to sit on my lap and I normally tell her to get down because it just feels weird.

We called him, he answered and Q asked him if was excited for this raging college party on Friday night our oldest friend(M) got us into, btw there was no party, and R was confused. Q and I jokingly tried to remind him of all the booze and drugs that would be there and he kept denying it, growing more and more nervous to the point of stuttering. The nail of the coffin came when I said something along the lines of ""You remember Clarissa, that smoking hot senior from M's sorority? Well she can't wait for you to do more body shots"" Q died laughing and we expected the same from R but all we heard was his mom yelling at him to hang up, so he did. Yesterday at school R told us we got him grounded, his phone confiscated and chores up to his eyelids. Not to mention he isn't allowed out of the house unsupervised for two months. 

R told us to go fuck ourselves and hasn't spoken to us since. Q felt bad and apologized to him and is somewhat on his good side but I kinda don't feel bad. He could've said when he answered the phone that his mother was there like we all do when we get a call with our parents nearby but he decided not to. I feel bad that he got put on essentially house arrest but I don't regret the call. The group is split down the middle with M on my side and our other friend on R's side. Q is on the fence but is trying to get me to apologize so we can all just be friends. I refused and still do. 

But I've been thinking about it more and I don't know if I'm in the wrong here for not apologizing so I came here to Reddit during my class freetime. Am I the asshole here?",15.0,F

Since he was a puppy and until today we're not able to approach him while he's eating because he turns violent: first growling and then barking. We warn all our visitors to not give him food and avoid him when he's eating. He has also always been afraid of loud noises. For a few weeks now he stopped sleeping in his bed and he now naps and sleeps in our closet.

In January we moved to Canada where we have a new home, new friends and a completely different weather than what he was used to back in Mexico. We thought he was fine until he bit me in May. He was licking a bone I had just given him, I crossed my legs and he came at me from almost 2 meters away and grabbed my arm. I ended up in the emergency room, I was 3 months pregnant then (I'm still pregnant now btw).

We engaged a behavior specialist and he told us our dog was acting out of fear. He suggested a few training exercises, which we aced, so we thought everything was on the right path until he attacked my husband and a few days later he went for my foot. He didn't do any damage, but he attacked when no food was involved. Since then, we started setting up boundaries, our dog was not allowed in the kitchen and living room anymore. We noticed the banning from those places upset him, but we felt it was necessary because we now didn't know what triggered an attack. At this point, we knew we would never be comfortable with having him near our kids, so we started looking to rehome him, even after our behavior specialist and our vet advised to put him down because they think the issue is neurological.

Last week my husband hosted a BBQ at our home and our dog bit one of our friends as he was passing in front of the dog's bed while he was there. He drew blood and actually damaged our friend's leg. We've now decided to put him down, because we haven't found a farm (someplace open) that will take him and I honestly feel like we're living with a time bomb that might go off anytime. I don't want him to bite me or anyone else again.

I might sound cold retelling this story, but I can honestly tell you that these last few months have been a very painful journey for me and my husband. We have a baby on the way and we always thought our doggie would meet our kids and grow old with them. I don't think the guilt of moving and failing our dog will ever go away.

So reddit, WIBTA if I put my dog down?

EDIT: I just want to say that this is our first dog ever. I'm not delusional enough to say we did everything right during his training, but we researched and we saw a lot of training tutorials when we did this. He's trained to heel, sit, lay down, go to bed and we have ALWAYS taken him out twice a day for a walk. His only issue used to be around his food and we managed to avoid it, I realize this was a big mistake on our side. Thanks for all your comments: the good and the bad ones.

EDIT 2: We looked into surrendering him to a shelter and we even had our behavior specialist write a letter with his diagnosis. We're looking for a home with no kids and a very large field so he can live outside, but please note that this is Canada and winters are bad so these kind of places are not common.

TL: DR at the end.

&#x200B;

I (25F) work in a very small office with 3 other people, one of them being my coworker Gary.

&#x200B;

Gary is a parent in his late 30's, married, with two kids.

&#x200B;

I'm newer to the step-mom scene. In fact, legally I'm not a step-mom. I'm engaged to my wonderful fiancé, Jared(30M). Jared has two daughters that are 6 and 11. We own a home together, the girls have their own space, and we have custody of the youngest 60% of the time. Both the girls mothers wished me a Happy Mothers Day and I did the same for them.

&#x200B;

Now, that being said when we have discussions about children Gary likes to try and ""reassure me"" that I will ""understand when I have my own kids"". Just recently he was asking if we were bringing the girls to a day camp next month. He makes sure to always include my fiancé Jared's name in the conversation as if I could not do anything with them myself.

&#x200B;

I let him know that we work and that we don't usually have the girls during most of that time per our custody arrangement but that my mom could bring them the last day. (We have our 6-year-old Friday-Tuesday and the 11-year old is here for the summer but goes back to spend the week before and that specific week with her mom, they BOTH will be back the last day of this event). He got flustered and told me that our custody arrangement was confusing and I will really love having ""my own child"" because I won't have to deal with that nonsense. I did combat this and said if we planned ahead we could have worked this out as we change schedules easily but this thing was not one we wanted to prioritize. This apparently frustrated him even more. He let me know it was ""different"" when you have your own kids as you can do what you want with them. He followed it up with letting me know that things will change after we have a child of our own because we won't get a break from them like we do right now.

&#x200B;

This really rubbed me the wrong way as I think of the children as my own and I'm really sick of him telling me that I don't understand things because they are not mine. I do not know what in his mind disqualifies me as a parent when the children and their moms think of me as their step-mom. In my culture we do not say things like step/half/adopted, family is just family. My fiancé is from the same culture as well so its really lovely to not have to explain this. I feel blessed that his family, the girls, and their mothers love me and accept me as a step-mom. I don't know what to do honestly because it's not like he is going to stop being my coworker anytime soon.

TL:DR: My co-worker does not think I'm a real parent because I'm a step-parent and we do not have 100% custody of the children and he likes to tell me whenever an event comes up where we do not have the kids.

Then, I (22M) mentioned it to my boyfriend (24M) and he got really upset.

He told me he's never been crazy about raves and music festivals, and after going to one he thinks it's basically just an excuse for people to do drugs. He said he's really uncomfortable and a little scared at the idea of me ""being on a bender for three days straight"" at a festival with hundreds of other people who are also tripping balls. He doesn't think it's safe, and told me he doesn't want me to go at all. Since the show we went to together, I haven't been to another so I guess he didn't feel the need to mention it until now, but he's really emotional about this. He said he just doesn't trust raves/people who go to raves and I said since I already bought the ticket I'm going to go anyway.

71056,71056,dky03e,1571650412.0,AITA for resenting my SO for traveling so much?,"Throw away account. Sorry if I’m not doing this right. I’ve been a longtime lurker, but this is my first post.

Me (26F) and my boyfriend (28M) have been together for many years. We live together, we have similar interests, overlapping friend groups, similar sense of humor, common goals, etc. We love each and we’re happy together. But there’s a part of me that resents how much he travels. 

He used to have to travel for work, which was hard for me, but understood that that was part of his job. During those few years, he was often gone more than not. Eventually he changed occupations, still had to travel but far less often, so that allowed him to be at home more. I became used to him being at home, and us spending more quality time together, and had really enjoyed this.

But over the past six months or so, he’s started to travel heavy again but mostly for leisure. What frustrates me is that over the past 2 months he has been on the road for more weeks than not, and I’ve rarely seen him. And just to clarify, he works from his computer and has the flexibility to bring work where ever he goes.

I believe traveling is an important, by learning about different cultures and seeing landmarks and gaining new experiences. I also believe it really important for people in a partnership to have independent lives and experiences outside the partnership, for many reasons. But I just miss him, and am bitter that he hasn’t been home most of these 2 months. Because we’re both busy, it’s hard to find moments of quality time together, and it’s even fewer now. I feel like we’re missing out on building experiences together. I feel like I get stuck with all of household responsibilities. I feel like I can’t get used to him being around cause he’s just going to leave to take another trip. And I guess I’m just really starting to feel really lonely in the relationship, even though we talk frequently when he’s traveling.

I’ve asked him to slow down a bit, but it was met resistance and excuses, which bothered me. What bothers me even more is that when he’s away, he thanks me for being understanding and chill about all the travel, when I’m not really okay with it.

I would be very understanding if it was for work, and wouldn’t angry. And I would be totally cool with him traveling for leisure, but just at a less frequent rate (like 2.5 - 3 weeks out of 8). And I enjoy traveling too and I would love to go but I have obligations that have prevented me from going with, and that’s not likely to change soon.

I started working at a gym in May. I lifeguard two days a week and help out with the youth wrestling program 2 days a week. Through working there I met a girl (16F) who goes to a different school. We usually take our lunch breaks around the same time and realized we have a lot in common. Last week we started meeting up to play basketball at the gym and run the track. I asked her to go see a movie with me this Friday and she said it should be okay but she has to ask her parents first. She came to me today and said her parents are okay with it but want to meet me first. I thought that sounded normal and I asked if they knew I was black. She was visibly taken aback and said, ""No. Do you think my parents are racist?"" I told her that I wasn't assuming they were racist but you never know and I didn't want to walk into some messed up situation. I don't think it'll be like ""Get Out"" or anything and know it's 2019, but I have white friends who say their parents wouldn't be okay with them dating interracially so it's obviously still 'a thing' in my area, which is a majority white southern town. I don't want anyone to be uncomfortable or surprised, so I figured a heads up would be fair. 

I explained this to her and she asked if she ever did anything to make me think that she comes from a racist family. I again told her that it's not that I think her family is racist. It's more that I don't know if they are or not and didn't want to make things weird and I don't want to start liking her only to realize she can't date me. I asked if she ever dated anyone in general before and she said the one boyfriend she had was white and she never felt the need to tell her parents that before they met him.

She texted me back later today and said, ""If you aren't comfortable meeting my parents then maybe it's best if we hold off on the date until sometime in the future when you are more comfortable.""

35247,35247,bv27pk,1559271130.0,WIBTA for asking my mom to tell her customer not to bring her two autistic sons to our home anymore?,"Context:

My (16f) mom works from home as a stylist & has a salon in our basement. I don't mind this because the stairs are right by our front door, so I can avoid awkward conversations by going into our kitchen when her customers are around. I don't do this out of rudeness, I am just not very social.

However, my mom recently picked up new customers - mother & her two very autistic sons (both in their early 20s, around 6'2 & probably near 300 pounds - I am 125 lbs & 5'6). I go to public school where there are a lot of autistic students, so I am comfortable around people with mental obstacles & do not have a problem with working with them. 


However, my mother's new customers are violent & very invasive. They have never actually harmed either my mom or myself, but they shake their fists (threateningly) at my mom before she does their hair & yell because they don't want their hair cut. (According to her, once she begins doing their hair they settle down.) One time when I was home, I was sitting in our dining room, which is upstairs and a ways away from our stairs, & all of the sudden I hear footsteps and one of the boys is walking into the kitchen. He asks me for a glass of water. No big deal - I'm often asked to bring my mom's customers a glass of water or a can of pop, I'm used to it & don't really care. I get him a glass of water & he downs it pretty quickly, puts it on the counter, & heads back downstairs. A few minutes later, he comes back upstairs with one of those Ring Pops (a plastic ring with candy on it, for anyone who doesn't know), shows me & tells me that he was going to marry me. I was slightly taken aback, & he insisted again. This made me uncomfortable, & I made some remark (kindly) along the lines of, ""I can't marry you, I'm still in highschool!"" He kept insisting until his mother came upstairs and they left. 

The most recent time they were here (2 days ago), he saw me when he came in the door & immediately started talking about marrying me. No specifics, just referring to me as his wife, etc. I grew more uncomfortable, but he went downstairs and I shook it off. While they were downstairs, I was in the dining room again doing homework. I hear footsteps coming up the stairs, but this time they dont come towards me. I wait a few minutes, & then go see what he's doing. He is standing in the doorway of my bedroom, just looking around. I know for a fact my door had been closed. My level of discomfort rises significantly. My mom tells me that when they get their hair cut & I'm not home, he asks about me constantly - my mom is under the impression that I'm okay with it, she is not TA as far as I'm concerned.

I would like to talk to my mom & ask her to have a conversation with the mother about not bringing them to our home anymore because it makes me very uncomfortable. I don't think the boys are intentionally making either of us uncomfortable, but I am worried about our safety.

However, on his birthday, my wife likes to act like it's his actually birthday.I mean, she will buy birthday cakes, balloons, little presents and even go to the cinema/bowling and other things a child would do on a birthday.

When we first started dating I was never really active on social media, only ones where I remained completely anonymous, like tumblr etc. 

And then when we started dating she encouraged me to try my hand at other platforms, snapchat I loved, but I was pretty open about not liking facebook or instagram, and asked her not to be upset if I didnt enjoy them. Now as time goes on these platforms really just end up stressing me out. I'm a very anxious person, which is why I decided to stay anonymous online, and now I feel so exposed and naked and I was just genuinely super uncomfortable with the whole thing. Now heres where things start going wrong, and I'll admit I'm at fault in a big way.

I tell her I dont enjoy fb or insta, but that snap is fun, expecting her to be supportive and allow me my privacy, but instead she gets very mopey and spends the rest of the day in slump, only coming out of it when I agree to try again. I KNOW I should have stood my ground and told her that it made me uncomfortable, but both me and her are so depressed and anxious, I decided I'd do my best to appease her. Then she starts pushing me to get into more communities on tumblr and fb, be more active, talk more about myself, and it's all stressing me out super bad, and tonight it all came to a head with a pretty bad fight. 

I thought I did a good job explaining to her why social media makes me so uncomfortable and that I'd rather lay low than make myself so seen. She blew up at me and I blew up back and now it's just awful. She said it's fine and to just delete my other social media account but she did it in a very throwing-her-hands-up-in-frustration-sighing-very-loudly-and-really-only-conceding-to-make-me-feel-guilty way, like a parent who asks their child to do a chore and when they kids throws a tantrum they say ""fine! I guess we'll just live in a pig sty then!"" And stomp off. The difference being, I feel like I'm completely within my rights to not enjoy this and want to stop.

I know I was wrong by not being firm, but does she really have a right to be so mad at me for not forcing myself to do something that makes me uncomfortable? Should she accept that I'm not the type of person who enjoys social media, or am I the asshole?

EDIT: She has two reasons she wants me on social media, firstly, so she feels thought of throughout the day, and secondly so people know she isnt single. I've tried to fix both of these by suggesting other ways I can make her feel thought of (which she doesnt accept) and by asking her to put that she isnt single in her bio (which she has done (she did always have it in her bio, but she just put it as our anniversary date with some hearts by it, which I told her most people wouldnt understand, so she changed it to be more clear))

Rose and I have been together 3+ years and moved in together last September. When we moved in Rose gave me permission to punish Jake, but I've never used it.

Rose punishes Jake with his playstation. He has stuff he has to do each week. If he does everything he gets max 10 hours on playstation spread out over the week. If he does anything bad  that's a demerit and takes hours off his overall time. He gets grounded sometimes, but only if what he does has an effect on others.

Yesterday I picked Jake up from school. His friends were going to the park with their parents, and Jake wanted to go with them. I wanted to be back in time to make dinner so I said if we went then we needed to leave by 4:30. Jake agreed, so I took him. We arrived at 3:20. At 4 I gave him a 30 minute warning. At 4:30 I tell him it's time to go. The other kids and their parents left. I gave it 5 minutes and then told him again. Jake asks for 5 more minutes. I say fine but then we need to leave. At 5pm, several warnings later, it's started to rain and we were meant to leave 30 minutes ago. I say ""you've had extra time, we've been here nearly 2 hours, it's time to go home. Now."" Jake says no. Out of frustration I call Rose, who tells me to try one more time and be sterner, so I do. When that doesn't work she asks to be put on speaker, and then in her mum voice she says ""Jacob Middlename Lastname! Get in the car now!"". It works.

I am now embarrassed and pissed off, because I was telling him to leave for 30 minutes, and Rose got him to leave immediately over the phone. I start driving home and I don't rant or yell but I say that I did him a favour taking him so I expect him to not play up like this. Jake says he was just having fun. I get more annoyed and tell him that because he delayed us for 30 minutes, he can either have the equivalent of 15 demerits or he can be grounded for the rest of the week. Up to him. I know I went in really strong considering it was only half an hour but I was tired, embarrassed, angry, wet, and Jake was acting like he'd done no wrong.

We got home, I told Rose what I said. She said ""I really wish you hadn't done that"". I remind her that she told me I could. She then reminds me that as she and her ex split custody and agreed to uphold the same reward/punishment system the 15 days or demerits will now carry into his week with Jake.

Rose says that in order to handle this and for me to save face with Jake she wants me to offer him some sort of deal, like if he apologises then I lower it to 5 days or demerits.

The way I see it is I can't back down at all. This is the punishment I set, and while it was in the heat of the moment, it will stop him from doing it again. Jake pulled that shit in the park because he didn't think I'd punish him. If I back down now then he will walk all over me.

Little bit of background but I'm 33 weeks pregnant with my second kid. My baby shower takes place on April 27th so I'll be about 36 weeks by then. I've had a pretty difficult pregnancy too and wondering if im being just completely hormonal and overreacting. Oh also on mobile so sorry about the formatting. On with the situation.

My sister being the lovely gal she is is planning me a baby shower and we have a set date, invitations are sent out, people have rsvp'd to it, things are going good. My father gets his invitation as well as a verbal one from me over the phone. He tells me that he has a sound engineer gig with a band he works with that night but he'll see what he can do. Now I've known the lead singer of the band for over 10 years and he is a super sweet and family oriented man. He himself has missed gigs because of family events.

Fast forward a week later and the lead singer is brought up in casual conversation with my dad when he is visiting me and my son. So having not heard from my dad about if he could make it I say ""oh speaking of brad have you had the chance to talk to him about finding a replacement? Or how is this going to work exactly?"". That's when my dad tells me he has no intention of even trying to talk to Brad about sitting this gig out. Like he isnt even going to bother to try. So he flat out lied to me over the phone about trying to ask for the day off.

I get very upset by this because of the fact that this is very important to me as we are also revealing the gender plus it's the first time my fiancee's and my family's are going to mingle and get to know each other. We have a rather large blow up about it because he basically told me that he made this commitment to the band 4 months ago and that if I would have told him sooner then he would have been able to go. The baby shower wasnt even being planned yet. 

Now I'm not mad about the fact he can't go due to work because I know there are some extenuating circumstances sometimes. My own best friend doesn't know if he can make it just because he isn't allowed to ask for that specific day off (retail sucks donkey butt). I'm upset about the fact that he wont even try and ask. I'm honestly very hurt by this and the fact that, at least to me, he doesnt care enough to even just put forth the effort to ask. If he had asked to not go to the gig and was told no he needed to be there I would have been upset he couldn't make it but not upset with him and would have been much more understanding.

So reddit am I the asshole in this situation? Please be honest cause if I am then I need to hear it from strangers who have little to no reason to placate me and commiserate.

ETA: for the people that have brought up that baby showers are predominantly women things I just wanted to not be a special snowflake but to say that most friends of both my fiance and I are male and that it's a completely coed and mixed event. Pretty much all events that my sister throws are totally mixed and my dad knows and totally supports that. Also while this is my second kid I was never able to have a shower for my first baby because of financials and other bullshirt like a high risk bedrest pregnancy. And since this seems to be a pretty common comment and I dont want to have to repeat myself honestly I didnt even think about his schedule. It's never been an issue with any other party that we've attended just because he always asks for it off and makes sure the day is clear. I'm more upset that he lied about the fact he was going to ask. We're very close and hes never lied to me like that before.

The baby shower wasnt even being planned yet. 

Now I'm not mad about the fact he can't go due to work because I know there are some extenuating circumstances sometimes. My own best friend doesn't know if he can make it just because he isn't allowed to ask for that specific day off (retail sucks donkey butt). I'm upset about the fact that he wont even try and ask. I'm honestly very hurt by this and the fact that, at least to me, he doesnt care enough to even just put forth the effort to ask. If he had asked to not go to the gig and was told no he needed to be there I would have been upset he couldn't make it but not upset with him and would have been much more understanding.

So reddit am I the asshole in this situation? Please be honest cause if I am then I need to hear it from strangers who have little to no reason to placate me and commiserate.

ETA: for the people that have brought up that baby showers are predominantly women things I just wanted to not be a special snowflake but to say that most friends of both my fiance and I are male and that it's a completely coed and mixed event. Pretty much all events that my sister throws are totally mixed and my dad knows and totally supports that. Also while this is my second kid I was never able to have a shower for my first baby because of financials and other bullshirt like a high risk bedrest pregnancy. And since this seems to be a pretty common comment and I dont want to have to repeat myself honestly I didnt even think about his schedule. It's never been an issue with any other party that we've attended just because he always asks for it off and makes sure the day is clear. I'm more upset that he lied about the fact he was going to ask. We're very close and hes never lied to me like that before. ",33.0,

I told my mother last Friday that I did not want to have a baby shower, the next morning she went ahead and made a Facebook evite and invited all of her friends to a baby shower for today’s date. I called her to ask why she did that after I told her I didn’t want one and she said that it was her first grand baby and that I needed to have one.

She apologized and said that she cancelled the event, I confirmed it on Facebook. She said, instead we would have an intimate lunch with just her, my dad, my brother, my husband and I. I agreed to it.

I'm 18 and my brother is 22.  He's been obnoxious and lazy most of his life, but it's gotten much worse. 
Near Christmas last year, he went to a party with some friends, smoked a ton of weed and then decided to drive. My parents have asked him not to drive while high endless fucking times, that they'd pick him up. But he never listens because he doesn't like that they tell him he needs to cut back on partying and getting high and do something useful with his life.
But on his drive home, he lost control of his car, (He says he doesn't remember exactly how he lost control), spun out and hit a tree off the side of the road above the driver's side door.
He was injured, he hit his head and hurt his neck, and part of the side of the car cut into his leg.  
He called an ambulance and they had to get fire-fighters to cut the door open.
He was taken to hospital and was there for 3 days. He ended up have some fairly serious damage to his calf and knee and now has a slight limp. His neck was in a brace for a while but that's mostly fine now.

But since then he's been acting like he's a fucking veteran who was injured doing something heroic. 
He's posted on Facebook about how he'll never recover from that night and how cruel fate is and other stupid shit. 
My parents are letting him get away with this bullshit, he quit his minimum wage retail job because ""It's too hard with my leg"", but won't work anywhere else. He sits at home playing games, smoking weed, and letting my parents treat him like a toddler. They cook his meals, clean his room, do everything for him and won't say no. They even give him money so he can ""Feel independent"".  Money which just goes to weed, games and Uber eats.  Not to mention they paid his fine for driving under the influence. 

The other night he made another self pitying bullshit post, so I got mad and called him out in the comments. I told him he needed to stop acting like a whiny bitch, and that it was his fault for getting high like a fucking moron and driving. I said he needs to stop sitting at home feeling sorry for himself and do something.

Disclaimer: I am 26 now so this isn't unfolding right now but I have always wondered what others may think.

Backstory- I have always been close with my dad. He was my best friend growing up and I considered him a best friend even into my twenties. We had a very honest relationship with mutual respect and love for one another.
When my mum passed away my dad and I were  distraught.

My dad (55yo) then 'fell in love' with someone who was, at the time, my age- 24yo. I didn't know the girl or have mutual friends with her. To my knowledge this relationship is sexual.
They have now been in a relationship for a bit over 18 months.
Just as a side note, I'm not really interested in discussing the details as to how this relationship came about.

Anyway, this ruined me. Importantly (to me), my dad is aware that this would ruin me. I felt like this was disrespectful to me and my mum. I felt like I didn't even know this man anymore. I feel like I have gone through every possible thought experiment to try to come to grips with this situation but I still feel like the dad I knew would not do this to me, no matter how much he was grieving.
My thought process is that he is grieving, I am grieving and I would not do something that I knew would hurt my dad and potentially affect our relationship in order to regain happiness for myself.

My boyfriend at the time, however, completely disagreed. His perspective is that if I love my dad I will accept him for who he is and support him through this time of grief and however he tries to find happiness. 
I haven't been able to face my dad. I can't even talk to him on the phone because I feel like there's always an elephant in the room. I've put distance between myself and him as I've tried to come to terms with this and my bf views this as me ""disowning"" him in his time of need.

I ask when will the party start because my older sister is notorious for never starting anything on time. I was told the party would start when I get there since it'll just be me, my children, my sisters, her children, and my older sisters gf. We were going to Chuck E Cheese.

I feed my girls breakfast and we head out. We get there at 1. Nobody is dressed or ready and my older sister is getting her hair done. I hadn't eaten yet because I thought we would go when I got there. My sister says relax, we can have sister time that I always want. My little sister goes to sleep and my older sister is watching tv or talking with her gf while doing her hair. I'm hungry, but they keep saying we're going to go soon. Over time, my kids get hungry, so I say we're going to go home because I have no idea when we're going to go, and everytime I ask I'm told I'm rushing them. Finally at 5 we go. My older sisters gf gets 4 play cards with time for the kids, but doesn't let the kids hold them because they lose them. They also just get 2 medium pizzas for 5 adults and 5 children. So I get a medium pizza and a card with points because my youngest would waste the time. She is playing a game with my younger sister and my sister takes the tickets and puts them in the birthday boy pile. I say no, those are her tickets. So my sister grabs them and gives them to me and my sisters gf goes off saying I'm stealing tickets from the bday boy. I say no, they're her tickets. My older sister comes over and says ""well [gf] bought the cards, and it is customary to give your tickets to the birthday person at the end of the party."" That makes absolutely no sense to me because my children played the games, and when it comes time to cash in the tickets, they're going to want something. And, I bought the card my youngest was using so it is her tickets. I say whatever, give them all the tickets and the cards back and we leave. AITA?

Original post:


I'm sitting in the kitchen and this friend of my daughter (12 F) who is spending the night starts talking about anal beads (I ask her to stop), then sexting and finally sex swings. Clearly she didn't stop.

My daughter (10 F) starts asking for more info about anal beads and I say no. Not right now at least.

I go tell my son (I'm fucking shell shocked at this point) and he tells me she (12 year old) went with them to see 'Good Boys' yesterday. Apparently her mom went too and explained these things to her. My son is friends with her older brother.

History: This girl taught my 9 year old (at the time) what (bad things are - mod removed previous post) is. I'm getting frustrated because I always thought I'd teach her about these things when she's ready. And I definitely didn't think I'd have to teach her about anal beads or (bad things) at 10 years old!!

I'm not prude or religious or anything like that. I will always keep an open discussion with my kids. But, am I the asshole if I tell the mother of this girl that I don't want her daughter around mine? It's getting to be too much. The mom is super sensitive and gets mad at me if we have other plans and the girls can't see each other. I also don't want to upset my daughter and she can't see her friend.

38911,38911,c13c2n,1560640064.0,AITA for taking a shower without telling anyone else in the house?,"There's quite a few people that live in my house - a few step-siblings, my half brother, my step mom, and my dad. The water's almost always being used for laundry or other people taking showers, and it doesn't help that my siblings aren't the most clean people ever.

My step-mom takes a shower every single day, as does my half-brother. Usually at the same time (he's 4 years old and autistic so he can't take a shower on his own, so it helps to make it a two-birds-one-stone situation). My step-siblings usually go by an every other day basis. Dad normally takes his way early in the morning when no one's awake before going to work, and laundry has no rhyme or reason. If it needs done, it's going to be done. Which is almost all the time due to how many people are in the house. I'm also supposed to take a shower on an every other day basis.

Except I can't. The water being used all the time makes it nearly impossible to find a moment in the days I'm supposed to shower on without finding out that someone else is about to use the water, currently is using the water, or has used it recently enough that there's little-no hot water left. Earlier I finally found a time where everyone else was outside and playing, and figured that since they'd be out there for a while, no one else had used the water recently, it was a perfect time to just enjoy a nice hot shower. I hadn't gotten to take one in about a week, so it felt good to get the grease out of my hair.  
Turns out they ended up coming back inside a lot sooner than I thought they would. Half-bro ended up soiling himself, so they had to come in early and take a shower to wash it off.

Since I *just* got out of a 15-20 minute shower and never informed anyone I was taking one, they went in and only had about 5 minutes of warm water before it went cold. According to my step-sis, step-mom got really angry and upset about this as she had a poop-covered toddler and hadn't gotten to shave herself in 3 days, and said I have to start telling her before I took a shower now. No one else has to say when they're going to be taking a shower as far as I know, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did.

On one hand, the water's run cold on me several times in the past before from no one else notifying when they just used the water. I also couldn't care less about her not being able to shave for a few days since I haven't gotten the oil out of my hair for about a week. Her only having 5 minutes is ironic as the shower I'm supposed to use was so clogged at one point that you only had about 5 minutes before it was flooded, 20 minutes before it drained.

On the other hand, you can't control when a kid soils themselves, and an autistic toddler is very hard and stressful to take care of. Having a kid scream at you all the time really grinds on your nerves. My step-siblings aren't the easiest to care of either with how much trouble they cause.

MIL is insisting that we all fly to visit my husband's extended family for their Christmas (the 28th). I am super reluctant to travel, given the germy-ness, expense, inconvenience of lugging stuff, and the fact that my otherwise loveable 4 month old is prone to meltdowns (as 4 month olds often are). I am the primary caregiver, have done 99% of the night shifts, and am the de facto baby wrangler when baby is losing his shit, as he often does because he nearly never naps and totally refuses a pacifier or bottle (we're exclusively breastfeeding). I am exhausted most days and haven't slept for more than 4 hours at a stretch in probably 6 months.

Spending 4 hours in a germ-filled tube with a possibly inconsolable baby to go hang out in freezing weather (in-laws are in WI, we're in AZ), only to have my new baby passed around at a 20 person Christmas sounds like torture to me. Not to mention they have 3 (albeit small) dogs and an endless stream of visitors, family aside.

Husband has some legitimate reasons for wanting to go, like rarely getting time off, spending time with his family, and introducing everyone to the new baby. Hubby would likely not press the issue if it weren't for the guilting. My otherwise great pre-baby MIL is (understandably) finding it difficult not to be close to her first grandchild, but has put constant pressure on us about flying to visit (and has for months - since I was 3 months pregnant). She has put on the waterworks, talked about baby ""forgetting"" them, and various other guilt trips. She constantly talks about getting a ""do over"" with this baby, has insinuated that I'm a shut in for not dragging my baby around town at 1 month, and has done things like let my baby become so hungry (because she insisted on babysitting despite me telling her he doesn't take a bottle) that she allowed him to suck on her arm until it was bruised.

After a big argument with husband I allowed myself to be forced into going, but not without explaining that I absolutely did NOT want to do it and that I'd be setting clear boundaries for trip expectations. I plan on making the most of the trip, but also letting MIL know that her behavior is completely unacceptable.

I thought some clarification might save my face and that of other vegans: I'm never this militant with anyone else other than my sister; I love when my meat-eating friends make small changes. I happen to see my sister as a ""vegan role model"" (and the fact that she is a self-declared vegan), and I was taken aback when I learned she wasn't perfect. Also, kinda thought being vegan was a strict, 100% no animal-products definition (where the gatekeeping arises), but I'm in the wrong, it seems. Again, I'm all for people to eat what they like; other vegans I meet are of similar mindset.",,f

She told me to come downstairs and continued yelling stuff like ""don't make me go up there!"" And I knew she couldn't so I just stayed in my room crying. My dad called me and I explained the situation to him, he said if I didn't like her rules, then leave. Then my 16 y/o sister texted me ""mom said to leave the house"", so I packed.

I'm the go to ""Aunt"" for my friends' dogs as I get to spoil them with treats and always throw the balls/frisbees until the dogs are sick of it. I love dogs but don't want the responsibility of one. I also don't have the time to take care of one. I recognize this, and am happy with being the fun Aunt.




I took his little sister there one time and she had a blast. Her Mom and brother have 2 puppies (~6 months old) that are finally eligible to come.




BF told me FSIL wants to go this weekend. We confirmed the plans for Saturday. Now the FSIL says she can only ""pop by"" for a few hours and can't pick up the dogs. BF can't get the dogs as he's allergic to all animals with fur plus he's financially strapped since he has been paying back all his debt.





AITA for wanting to not go this weekend, or to reschedule the dog park when the FSIL can take the dogs? As it is, I'd have to drive 30 minutes to pick up the dogs from her Mom's house in the suburbs, pay the $15 to bring them in, sign the waiver for them, pay for the dogs while there, and then transport them back with another 30 minutes drive. 




I realize I sound selfish but it wasn't my idea to go this weekend. It was FSIL's. I just agreed to go because I live close to the dog bar. I am able to afford it, as I make double of what BF and FSIL make.

I asked our other friend that was there and she thought that it was a weird, but she said I didn’t sound mean or evil. She said, maybe it was all perception.

- 2 friends and I are out at a nice bar/club. David – who I’m really close with – and John who I met through David. John’s been out with us a few times. I considered John a bro by default, since David’s my bro and has been friends with John for so many years.

- Another friend of David’s, Will, joins us and decides on his own that he wants to buy a bottle for all of us to share out of his own generosity. We have a table exclusive to us thanks to Will. I’ve briefly met Will before, but this is the first time I’ve actually started to get to know him. 

- While away from the table, a blonde girl in a sparkly dress catches my eye. I set on a stool next to where she was sitting, say “Hi, I like your sparkly dress” with a smile. She finishes whatever she was doing on her smart phone, smacks her hand on my shoulder, says “you’re not my type”, briefly using my shoulder as leverage to get up and walk away. EDIT: Let me emphasise this: ***she laid her hands on me in an aggressive manner.*** It wasn't just words. 

- Whatever, I get it. I’ve got a lot of experience approaching girls and never let it phase me. I know that there’s just some girls out there with low self-esteem and need to put down others in order to make themselves feel a semblance of self-adequacy. 

- I return to our table, and it turns out there’s 2 or 3 girls there, talking to Will and David, and also… The sparkly dress girl, who is a friend of those girls. 

- If I chipped in for the bottle/table, I would’ve told the sparkly dress girl that since I’m not her type, she should take a hike, or perhaps call her out and explain how putting other people down isn’t the solution to a low self-esteem. But since Will paid for it all, and was trying to get with one of her friends, I was put in an awkward spot. I was pissed. I told Will & David that she was very rude to me, and asked if I could tell her to fuck off our table. They shrugged their shoulders and didn’t give any clear answer. In hindsight, I wouldn’t have asked. I would’ve just not been at the table and gone solo for the night at the other parts of the bar/club. 

- Anyway, she got up to leave. However, before she left, John started talking to her, so I decided that fuck it, because: 1. A guy who paid for the table is trying to get with her friend and 2. A bro by default is trying to get with the rude girl, I’m just gonna leave and go to another bar that I actually loved going to and know the staff etc. 

- David & John (who I had now explained how rude sparkly dress was to me) insisted I don’t leave, that I shouldn’t let it phase me, etc. I explained that I’m not mad at the girl herself, it’s just the situation that’s fucked. I don’t wanna fuck anyone’s shit up, but I don’t want to hang with that girl as if what she did was acceptable behaviour or not, I’ll just leave and be happy somewhere else. David said to John that he should ditch sparkly dress, but he didn’t. I told John not to, that it's fine, because I believe a friend wouldn't have to be asked to or explained why to not tolerate disrespectful behaviour towards his friend, he just wouldn't.

- I hung around a bit away from the table but eventually left. 

- Lessons learnt from the night: 1) I don’t consider John to be a friend anymore, as he tolerated disrespectful behaviour towards me for the opportunity to get laid and 2) I’m never gonna let anyone buy me anything again, because it creates unwarranted obligations on my behalf.

I ate the first half without an issue. When I started on the second half, I bit down on something hard. I opened up the roll to find a chicken bone in my sandwich at least an inch long.

I showed it to my mil and she couldn’t believe it. We waved the waitress over and showed her the chicken bone. She apologized and offered to get me another sandwich. I declined, partly because I’d eaten half of it and partly because I felt kind of queasy after finding something that should have been in the trash in my sandwich. Don’t get me wrong - I have no problem with chicken on the bone. But when you expect your chicken salad to be boneless it’s a lot different than picking up a chicken leg and eating the meat off of it.

She finished her lunch and most of the rest of mine stayed on the plate. I just lost my appetite. I also took a pic of the bone.

I ate the first half without an issue. When I started on the second half, I bit down on something hard. I opened up the roll to find a chicken bone in my sandwich at least an inch long.

I showed it to my mil and she couldn’t believe it. We waved the waitress over and showed her the chicken bone. She apologized and offered to get me another sandwich. I declined, partly because I’d eaten half of it and partly because I felt kind of queasy after finding something that should have been in the trash in my sandwich. Don’t get me wrong - I have no problem with chicken on the bone. But when you expect your chicken salad to be boneless it’s a lot different than picking up a chicken leg and eating the meat off of it.

She finished her lunch and most of the rest of mine stayed on the plate. I just lost my appetite. I also took a pic of the bone.

13703,13703,apxfla,1550001150.0,AITA for not wanting to invite my mom to my wedding?,"Hi Reddit,

So let me start by saying that my fiancee and I are engaged, and have been since like mid-November. We're getting set up to have our wedding in July. We just sent out our save-the-dates a couple of weeks ago, and my mother did not make the list of people we've sent these to.

I've had a pretty rocky relationship with my mom for most of my life. When I was growing up I never really had a concept of what it was to be a good mother and what it meant to be selfish and a mother who seems to have dulled motherly instincts. The man I grew up with around was not my biological father, rather a step dad, and I had really only known him to be my dad as my biological parents separated when I was two years old. My step dad was not really a nice guy and often acted out with his anger; nothing too severe that I know of, but when I wouldn't do chores, or talked back, I would often find myself getting whipped with a belt. I also chew my fingernails, for as long as I remember, I still do today. Back then, my parents tried to take action and would buy this weird formula from the store that you could put on your nails that put a horrible taste in your mouth, obviously to deter you from chewing your nails further. My step dad realized this was ineffective to me, I still would bite them, and I still remember him pinning me to the ground and basically dumping the remnants of the bottle into my mouth (though it was somewhat of a struggle so some on my face as well). I'm not sure to what extent my mom knows of these events, but nonetheless, the two of them got divorced when I was 7 I think. Needless to say, it was a pretty scarring event.

I went to go live with my grandparents briefly who snowbird in Phoenix where we lived, while the dust settled and my parents sold the house and my mom got a new living situation set up. During this time my grandparents were going to take me on a road trip to go meet my real dad and my half-sister for the first time that I would remember; I used to live with them when my real parents were still married, but I don't have any memories from that age. I don't remember any event that took place that I wasn't allowed to go with them, but I still remember the hype for that trip vividly... it wasn't until I visited my grandparents over New Year's this year that I brought it up with my grandma, and I asked her why that trip never happened. She explained that it was because my mom simply didn't trust them to take me. She also pointed out that my mom was selfish and pointed out that the houses we lived in, my mom splurged on nice furniture -- a new living room set, a new master bedroom set, new dining room set, the whole shebang. My room was a bed, a thrift store particle board side table, and a Target TV stand in the closet.

Anyway, I ended up living with my mom and would occasionally spend time at my step-dad's apartment. I think for a time my step-dad and my mom would try to work things out until they couldn't. I just realized one day I hadn't seen him in a while, and I never saw him again.

Things were fine for a while, I had changed schools due to those events numerous times as my mom moved around trying to get settled. I was happy, we went on vacations and I had friends and was comfortable where we were.

My mother then started seeing this guy who quite clearly had bad habits. He would bring over some his friends (whom I remember being homeless, I'm not sure if this is true or not) when my mom wasn't home and drove a shitty old white van and had his hair slicked back and must've been Italian or something, he was a real greaseball. His name was Robert. I never liked him, he occasionally made an effort to get my involved with his handyman business he would try to start up and make jokes and stuff. But I hated him, he was so off-putting and strange.

A breaking point came one day when I was in our office playing Roblox (this was 2007, I was such a pioneer) while I was on the phone with my grandma. I had my own cell phone and was charging it while on the phone, and I heard Robert come home with one of his friends, so I closed and locked the door to the office and kept doing my thing. He then knocked on the door and tried to come in, asking from the other side if I had a phone charger. I said yeah but I was using it, and he then proceeded to try and actually break down the door after I said I wasn't giving it up. I heard banging and yelling and he just couldn't get in, and my grandma was still on the phone and caught on. She was in Idaho at the time and called the local police from where she was at and had a unit dispatched. They showed up and my mom came home early after my grandma contacted her as well. I opened the door once things calmed down and the police arrived and there was a flathead screwdriver sticking out of the door frame like he was trying to break it off and get into the room. He was arrested that night and spent the night in jail obviously for a domestic dispute. I remember another time my mom had me call the police too because he was acting out, presumably because he was high as a kite.

A couple of days later, I woke up early one morning to Robert telling me to pack some stuff up, I was going to live with my grandparents. It was before school time and I remember he brought me to my mom's place of employment to say goodbye (she worked nights as a nursing home). I had never been told I'd be leaving until that morning. It was an emotional temporary goodbye.

A month or so goes by, and I'm attending a new school, and I'm meeting my dad and half-sister for the first time I'd remember. Obviously this got my nerves going a bit. Details here don't matter as much, I just continued my life somewhere new. I didn't keep in touch with my mom for a while, I didn't call or anything as it was sooo touchy. Eventually she decided she would come up to Idaho and start a new life up here. She actually did, and got her a nice house for rent a couple doors down from my grandparents. I was super excited.

And then my mom decided she didn't want to live in Idaho, and moved back to Arizona, and I stayed there while she could set life up. I went back and lived with my grandparents again, and while there, she and Robert got married. That's what I lost touch with her for years, and never went back to live with her.

Life happened and I then lived with my dad and step-sister in Minnesota. I don't remember how but I got her address and wrote letters -- we did this for quite some time. In the letters she said her and Robert had gotten a divorce. I had let go of some of my extreme bitterness when I read this, and she brought up a point that still sticks with me - she said there's no handbook of how to be a good parent. She also explained that she thought it was in my best interest to live with my grandparents, which I couldn't argue. To this day, I can't tell if she was actually meaning what she said, or if she was just being selfish so she could get married to a piece of shit.

We stayed in sparse contact for a long time, and eventually I went down to visit her. She told me Robert had actually died of a heart attack, and I couldn't decide if it was due to drugs or karma, and I found out she was living with this woman, and while it was never explicitly said, I believe they were romantic. I didn't care really, while she was kinda weird she was nice, and I don't care what you're into, as long as you're happy. I had a good time with them and went back home.

She then separated from her and met this guy named Peter who is in his 80s (my mom is in her 50s) and it's definitely suspiciously like a gold-digger situation. He's nice, albeit weird and has some Puerto Rican values about him which just rub me the wrong way, but whatever. My mom seems truly happy for the first time I've seen her. I visited her once and had the opportunity to meet Peter before I got to know my now fiancee, so I knew what to expect when we went down there. Their house is horribly cluttered, which I believe is Peter's doing -- it's almost on the scale of hoarding. Entire rooms in their house full of boxes and paperwork and irrelevant garbage. I warned my fiancee of this before we visited.

The time we spent with them was a *disaster*. Our relationship was going through some heavy shit at the time and weighed on us the entire time. I failed to communicate with my mom we would be spending a couple nights in a hotel close by since I knew the state of their house and I wanted us to have some privacy, and my mom and her husband went batshit over this, getting offended and didn't understand why we'd want a hotel room when they have a room for us. This room had a tooon of boxes in it, pictures of Peter's ex-wife, all sorts of weird shit.

We then decided to spend most of the time exploring the state. My mom tried to insert herself into my vacation and just wouldn't take no for an answer, she wanted us to leave our rental car at her house the rest of vacation to go to destinations her and Peter wanted to visit (which I was annoyed about mostly because I paid a premium for a Mustang convertible rental -- imagine how much it costs to rent that to a 21 year old!) but we finally communicated to them we would just like to explore by ourselves. When it came to say goodbye, she was bitter we didn't spend more time with them and literally scolded me like a child that I don't call or text her enough -- bear in mind she doesn't make the effort to do these things either. It was an extremely awkward and unpleasant experience for me, let alone at the time for my fiancee. She also made abundantly clear she wanted to be invited to our wedding.

Well, now we're getting married, and I had nothing but sour feelings for my mother. My fiancee has told me she doesn't want me to regret not inviting her but I think the regret of inviting her would greatly outweigh the regret of not doing so. My family does not like her at all and I feel it would ruin their experience. I can see her scolding me for not spending time with her outside of the wedding. I hold her accountable for stunting my social skills by moving me around during my childhood so fucking much, I changed school so many times I can't even keep track of them all and it turns out being the new kid that often takes its toll. I am awkward and unrelatable and unsocial. I find the way she treated us during our stay unacceptable, her actions during my childhood, everything. I do not want her there.

TL;DR - My mom gave me a fucked up childhood of moving around and dating mildly abusive men and has a selfish personality and would make our wedding awkward as hell.

2 years ago I started a relationship with (27F) that I met earlier in that year while studying to increase my chance of employment. She approached me; I wasn't ready for a relationship but she had the same condition (not as severe) and needed to fix things too so I told her we'd do it together.

When we met she thought she might be asexual but had a lot of trauma. She did increase the frequency, but we still disagree on it. There tends to be a week with 3x and then not as much the rest of each month (she tracks it, but I think it's less than it says). I'd like it to be 2-3 each week and think it's just a matter of effort; if she loved me it'd come naturally. 

She also has issues with anxiety and depression. I've been depressed too and I think she just needs to get outside and do things more often to get better, but she says she's comfortable at the computer, knitting (what 20 year old knits?) or drawing/colouring in (which is childish and needs to stop). 

In the last 10 months she went through a lot of therapy, got a job in the field we studied and was promoted at the end of her probation. She moved far away to do that (which I encouraged) and she's been asking me to move with her, but I don't want to lose my financial independence by moving before I have a job. I also don't want to limit myself to looking for work near her because there's not as much there, so I'm looking around back home.

The other thing is that she's ticked off all these goals (she's got the job, the house, the car) but she's not exactly happy. If I have to live with her moods wings or misery that would just drag me down and I can't have that because my life is about to improve so much. 

A few days ago she was trying to ask me when I'd be willing to move in (yet again) and I wouldn't commit to a date so she said she was done even though I tried explaining why I couldn't commit yet and that I do love her. The next day she asked for keys back/where to send my things and I asked her what was going on. She called me and I told her I thought we needed a cooling off period in case we changed our minds. I told her she has to be happier if she wants me to move in and she asked how she's supposed to demonstrate that. I suggested smiling more and sending me photos and texts of her doing happy things.  

Honestly though, I'm not sure if this relationship is a good idea. I don't know if I  fear being stuck with her or losing her more. She's been crying that I've been killing her and need to make a decision, but I think shes overreacting to the situation and doesn't seem that worried about losing me or she'd have put in more effort. 

AITA for telling her ""I love you and I want a future with you"" just fix [problem] first when I'm not sure if I do want to be with her (at least until I know she's changed) or is it her responsibility to draw a line if I really am hurting her that badly? Just want some more opinions...

36177,36177,bwkx0j,1559625066.0,AITA for prioritizing my dog over my kids?,"My dog is sick. She (potentially) has some kind of mammary cancer which is starting to develop. No one noticed until I brought her to the vet two days ago and they felt small pea shaped cysts growing on her belly. They've quoted me $1200 to do a biopsy to check whether it's cancerous or not, and if it is, they'll put her on chemo drugs. She's 11 and dogs of her breed tend to last 10-14 years. I keep some money aside for my dog for this express purpose. I've got $500 in a safe in case of emergency, and I don't mind adding the extra $700 out of pocket.

But my fiancee and I share finances. This is money I've always kept aside, even before I met her, so by all rights it's my money. We have a 4 month old daughter who is formula fed. My fiancee doesn't want to pay for the biopsy and instead wants to use the funds (which she didn't even know about until now) on our daughter. She needs formula, diapers, new clothes, an exersaucer, etc. We talk between each other before big financial purchases (over $200) and she says this is one of them and she is vetoing it.

A little context: I work part-time and my fiancee is not working right now to be a SAHM. Her family is rich. Ludicrously rich, but they don't share their wealth and instead keep it in investments. In emergencies, they'll give her some money but otherwise she earns whatever she can and that's it. I argue that I should take money that I earned and use it on my friend (and ostensibly a part of the family) and if we run into trouble, she should ask mommy and daddy for help. They won't help me, but they will help her.

So I did just that. My daughter needs things but I took the money and spent it on my dog. She had surgery today without my fiancee knowing. I played it off as I was hanging out with my friend with the dog. The dog is staying with my friend for now.

Am I the asshole? We aren't strapped now but it does make things harder. I was willing to make this sacrifice for my dog.

**Small update and correction:** the surgery is to remove the cysts and send them for analysis. Whether it's cancerous or not, the cysts are now gone. They said eventually they would become big (whether malignant or benign) and cause pain, and this surgery is preventing that pain and in the case of cancer, may be helping her out, too.

We are not strapped for cash. We collectively have about $6,000 in savings, so the $700 I took is of (relatively) little consequence. My fiancee was against taking any money for the dog, even if we could afford it. Whenever I want to spend something on myself or for our house, it always boils down to ""we might need the money for xyz for our daughter"", even if that never even happens. We will not be going without food or clothes or whatever. There's like a 1% chance this will cause us issues, and if it does, we have bigger things to worry about and her parents could help a little.

I understand things come up and the world doesn't revolve around me, but everyone has a cellphone and a single sentence saying sorry I can't make it, takes less than two minutes to type and send. Should I explain why I'm upset or do you think they should know? Or am I just taking this too personally?",,
