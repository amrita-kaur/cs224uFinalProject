So almost a year ago, my aunt (let's call her Bella), lost her uncle (so my great uncle?). She was there as he took his final breath in the hospital. I know that it must have been so hard to watch, and I genuinely feel bad for her. 


This is the only thing that we relate to. This woman, even after I was diagnosed with severe depression because of this and offered counselling, scoffed and made petty insults, insisting that there's nothing wrong with me, and that it's time to move on. She is quick to throw out the word ""baby"" when she sees tears forming in my eyes, and gets upset when I seem to at all be bothered by this. That's fine. She wants me to move on so that I can feel better. Except no. 


Aunt Bella still has days where she gets really upset, requests to be left alone, or will just snap at me for no real reason. 


She kept some roses from his burial, and insists that she take care of them for as long as possible. The only issue is that she asks me to do it, and she herself hasn't touched them since the day we brought them home. That's fine, I guess, but she often gets really mad and accuses me of not watering/tending to the roses, calling me a liar and insisting that I'm trying to make a fool of her or purposely kill the plants. Last night was another such night, and it ended in me going for a walk and not coming back for hours because I knew that it would only continue the second I walked through the door.

Caesar got mad at me today and called me selfish, rude, and a few other names because Bella had told him about last night and the roses. Again, name calling. He also decided to pile on the fact that I'm lazy or whatever because I was too tired from work and that walk to come take care of Bella's cat (whom I might be allergic to, and who hates me and leaves cuts all over me).

I’ve currently been sober for a year. 

Recently, my sister got married to a very wealthy man. Since then, she hasn’t wanted for anything. I’m happy for her. 

Since she got married though, I’ve sort of slowed down how much I’ve been paying her back and I haven’t sent her any money in a couple weeks. She has so much money now that anything I could ever give her wouldn’t matter and paying her back honestly makes me even more broke than I already am and I need every penny I can get. 

My sister was over at my house this week helping me just clean and get my stuff together (I’ve recently moved). 

At one point, while we took a break, she turns to me and asks me when I’m going to give her the rest of the money I owe her. 

I kind of looked at her incredulously and said that she couldn’t really expect me to pay her back when she now has so much money already. 

She got pissed at me and said that it was the money I owed her and that I need to pay her back. I told her she was being greedy and that she had enough money. 

She told me I was still acting like her junkie thief brother and left my place after that. 

She won’t respond to my calls or texts asking her to meet up with me and talk about it since then. 

I worked so hard getting myself to the point I’m at and I have so little money already and she had so much, that I don’t really know if I actually am the asshole for not wanting to pay her back.

I don't live in the same city as them so I can't be around as much as I would want to but through out the year I have been getting calls from my mother saying my brother's school work was slipping, that he spends all his time playing video games. He tells me that she is over exaggerating and he does not play as much as she says. When I do go around to visit, he spends 95% of his time staying up till 3+ am on his xbox playing shooters talking with friends over headset. Through out the school year, I started getting calls saying he was skipping classes, he would stay up too late playing games, When I call to talk to him about it, he would argue it was because he didn't have classes on those days. I try to encourage to go to bed at a sensible time and still use time away from class to study because we don't want him to fail his exams, he says he will and he has the exams in the bag, he studies the materials and knows the content very well.

This cycle continues for a few months where he starts talking about not liking the college because he is more interested in doing an Apprenticeship rather than going the degree route. So then unto 2 weeks ago, I get a call from my mother saying he failed all of his exams including 1 paper where he turned up late to it and another where he didn't turn up at all. I call him to ask him ""wtf?!"" He said he turned up late to the paper just because he accidentally over slept and missed the other one because no one told him he had a paper on that day.

I immediately called BS on the latter one because no school of any kind would not tell their students weeks if not months in advance that you have an exam scheduled for X date. It's then he tells me that he avoided going to class because he was being bullied.

I ask him why wait till now to mention it, he says he doesn't know but it had been going on for most of the school year, that is why he was avoiding going to class. He didn't tell anyone because he was too afraid.

I ask how many were there. He says 4...no 5- actually 6. This is the part that confused me. In my opinion, If there were people bulling you for nearly a year continuously, you would instantly know how many there are and their names.

I ask if he spoke to other students about it and he says no because he doesn't have any friends. I struggled to believe this because I remembered him talking about a friend he had in class and how he and said friend tried to organise a class trip to a convention a few months earlier (Which he failed to go to because once again, no one told him about needing a permission slip and money to go on a trip he was meant to  have planned.)

I only use them in the classroom while sitting.

I have been told to do this as their ""wedding present"". Also because a very old family member recently mistook the groom for myself. I have not seen this family member for a long time. I live several hours away from most of the family anyway. I don't see them too often, but will during the wedding. I am a member of the groomsmen. I don't feel it is okay to strongly request this, to the point of being overly upset if I choose to not follow their request. A request can be denied, and I am choosing to have a cleanly shaped beard, and not wear glasses that will make me nearly blind while walking around. I don't think I look too similar to the soon to be married groom. We look similar, but its quite easy to tell us apart. I don't feel its my issue to change my appearance for the wedding just because of a similarity. I find it upsetting that I am told to change my appearance because of their choice to marry a person that may look similar and not my choice that we do have a slight resemblance.

Edit: The close family member is my sister by the way. Also 1 parent seems quite upset that I am not going to follow their request, saying its a simple thing to do for them. Which yea, it is simple to do, yet I may be stubborn in my decision, but feels wrong to change my looks and fake on my part. And the other parent seems to completely agree with my decision.



I view it as altering my normal appearance to make the bride feel better about her insecurities. I am her brother, and being asked to cover up my looks so I am ""different"". Seems crazy to me. But in using these fake glasses, this will prevent several people from freaking out on me. I don't think it's a big deal at all if I look somewhat alike to the groom. Similarity is minor. Just 2 dudes with beards and same color hair.

Also, as many have suggested, I tried to step down from the wedding party. But that was also not allowed as I was told I have already accepted the responsibility of being a groomsmen and with it comes the responsibility of changing my appearance in this way.

Also as mentioned, I am not able to just simply not go as well. This would also upset the same people in the exact same manner and cause a potentially irreversible issue within the family...

So, a close family member is getting married soon. I have been told to either grow my beard out a lot, or shave it completely for the wedding. Or the option of wearing glasses that I only use while looking at classroom boards from far away, while sitting. The moment before I stand to walk around, I remove my glasses.

We have just reached the point in our relationship where he is starting to get to know my friends and we had even recently discussed him adding my mum on Facebook but I’m not exactly keen for her to be made aware that he likes thicc women and is unafraid to share this with the world.

When I brought it up with him, he was adamant that it’s “just content” and that he isn’t trying to start an interaction - he just reacts to it and then scrolls on. I think personally that if you’re not trying to start an interaction it’s easy enough to just look at the pic or save it. 

I’m a pretty chill person about this kind of stuff - I know we both have reddit porn accounts, follow hot people on social media, it’s totally ok in our relationship to bring up how attractive other people are, etc. I just draw the line at him reacting to that content on Facebook where people we know in real life (and people I want to get a good impression of him, because I really like this guy) can see it.

Now I’m starting to doubt myself and wonder if I’m being unreasonable for being upset over this.

&#x200B;

Next week I'm going to a conference about a 4 hour drive away. It's my third year going and I always drive myself. This conference is a super social event - there are panels and stuff, but it's mostly about industry networking, drinking and hanging out. I enjoy that stuff but I'm definitely the type of person who gets drained by too much socializing (especially this kind, where you have to strike that perfect balance between fun and professional). So I really relish that long solo drive on the way up and back - coming in, it helps me relax and get into a good headspace, and driving home it helps me unwind. 

&#x200B;

There is a guy who lives in my area, ""Jeff,"" who is also in this industry and attends these conferences. I like Jeff, he's a really friendly guy and it's nice to have someone from back home to hang out with when all the schmoozing starts to get exhausting. Jeff is also kind of my boss - not at my full time job, but he runs a small events company for which I do occasional work on weekends. So he's like my side hustle boss.

&#x200B;

Last year, Jeff sort of invited himself to ride home with me from the conference (he had taken a train in) and I rolled with it. He was... not a great passenger. He took calls on speakerphone and talked to them at top volume for a solid hour; when he was done with his calls and I asked if he minded if I listened to a podcast, he said it was fine but then proceeded to talk over it the whole time; and he left garbage in my car. He also didn't offer any gas money.

&#x200B;

So a couple weeks ago Jeff stopped by my office to say hi and the topic of the conference came up. He suggested that maybe he'll ride with me since I'm driving anyway (otherwise he takes the train). I left it at ""yeah maybe, let's see how our timing works out."" Ever since, I've been torn on what to do. I obviously don't want to give him a ride - I want my peaceful 4 hour drive of listening to music and podcasts in blissful solitude. Buuut that seems like a dick move, and my boyfriend agrees - when I suggested that I just be honest and tell Jeff that I need that alone time, my bf said that sounds ruder than just saying no without an explanation. 

  
I feel like it's rude to say no at all, but the thought of Jeff riding with me again is giving me anxiety. So WIBTA for telling him I can't give him a ride?

I like Jeff, he's a really friendly guy and it's nice to have someone from back home to hang out with when all the schmoozing starts to get exhausting. Jeff is also kind of my boss - not at my full time job, but he runs a small events company for which I do occasional work on weekends. So he's like my side hustle boss.

&#x200B;

Last year, Jeff sort of invited himself to ride home with me from the conference (he had taken a train in) and I rolled with it. He was... not a great passenger. He took calls on speakerphone and talked to them at top volume for a solid hour; when he was done with his calls and I asked if he minded if I listened to a podcast, he said it was fine but then proceeded to talk over it the whole time; and he left garbage in my car. He also didn't offer any gas money.

&#x200B;

So a couple weeks ago Jeff stopped by my office to say hi and the topic of the conference came up. He suggested that maybe he'll ride with me since I'm driving anyway (otherwise he takes the train). I left it at ""yeah maybe, let's see how our timing works out."" Ever since, I've been torn on what to do. I obviously don't want to give him a ride - I want my peaceful 4 hour drive of listening to music and podcasts in blissful solitude. Buuut that seems like a dick move, and my boyfriend agrees - when I suggested that I just be honest and tell Jeff that I need that alone time, my bf said that sounds ruder than just saying no without an explanation. 

  
I feel like it's rude to say no at all, but the thought of Jeff riding with me again is giving me anxiety. So WIBTA for telling him I can't give him a ride?

49454,49454,ci2vql,1564147782.0,AITA for pestering friends who stole a dog they thought was abused?,"My friends informed me last weekend that they had rescued an adorable dog. They said they picked it up off the street. The next day I figured it was worth looking at lost dog ads in the area and immediately found an ad posted by the owner saying they miss the dog and that their house is ""lonesome"" without their ""baby.""

&#x200B;

I texted the ad to my friends and they explained that they knew the owner was looking for it. The owner lives next door to their friends and their friends had told them that the dog often escaped and wandered around the neighborhood. It also was left outside in the cold too often and was left in a trash-filled yard, they said. This is third hand information for me, since it was my friends telling me their friends told them this about their neighbor.

&#x200B;

Anyway, my friends said they planned to keep the dog. Queue me freaking out. I immediately Googled the woman who posted the ad hoping she was some kind of deadbeat shitty person and learned she was a 60-year-old church lady who sews and bakes and has grandkids. By this point I was sobbing thinking about this woman not knowing where her dog was. She had posted to Facebook that she'd contacted animal control and the Humane Society.

&#x200B;

I felt like the right thing for my friends to do would have been to file a complaint with animal control or the humane society if the dog was not properly cared for. Maybe that would have gotten the owner to shape up. Or, they could offer to buy the dog. Or, they could offer to help the owner out fixing their fence or whatever they needed to better care for the dog.

&#x200B;

Alright, so instead of doing the grown up thing and coming out and saying that to their face I proceeded to ask them about six questions by text about why they'd decided to keep it and what the process had been for how they got it. Like, ""did you pick it up or did your friends?"" ""Did they try calling animal control first?"" ""Look, I'm really conflicted about this and sad thinking about the woman who lost her dog, can you tell me more about how you made your decision?"" Etc, etc. It was probably pretty stressful for them, but after all, they stole a dog.

&#x200B;

Finally, the guy in the relationship texted my boyfriend and said ""why is your girlfriend investigating us?"" And then they sent a series of text messages essentially expressing their displeasure with me ""digging"" into it. A day later they discovered the dog had a chip and they had to return it anyway!!! But they said it ""broke their heart"" to return the dog to what they thought was an abusive situation and they were hurt that I was ""rubbing it in.""

I hadn't meant to rub it in. I was honestly trying to 1) assess the situation and 2) convince them to return the dog and take an alternate path like calling animal control if they were worried about it.

We do Christmas two weeks early. I can't remember why we started but it's a practical lifesaver these days. Since I haven't had an opportunity to give either of them gifts, am very excited for the both of them, and want to put a positive foot forward, I got them a nice gift for Christmas. It's specific, so I can't say exactly what it is, but it wasn't offensively expensive (under $50), included gift receipt, and is something pretty much anyone would like, or at least not be upset to receive. It's like an upscale housewarming type thing, since they just got a place together.

&#x200B;

I gave it to them but noticed no one else got them anything. My brother gave a quick ""thanks,"" which is more than enough for me. But his fiance said in front of everyone that she didn't like one of the things that came with the gift and that it would be a hassle to find a place to put ""the whole thing"" (for context, isn't big or bulky or dangerous) I felt very sad and a bit embarrassed. I spoke to some cousins who said they didn't get her anything because she did the same thing to them last Christmas.

Later, my mother pulled me aside and said she felt sad too. I told her that I was just a bit disappointed, but that it was no big deal. I told her I would just avoid getting them presents in the future, and everyone else had already obviously taken the hint. She was upset to hear this and pointed out that fiance's bridal shower was Christmas Eve morning and everyone would be getting her something. I opted not to go because it is rude to show up without a preset to an event like that, but I also didn't want to be in the position of her telling a bunch of others that she hates the gift I got her. My mother is now mad at me, the fiance has posted some thinly veiled ""everyone hates me"" status on facebook because, apparently, I was not the only one to RSVP no then not send anything, and my brother doesn't seem to want to talk about anything with anyone, saying it would be a ""trigger"" to be stressed with family stuff, ever, so we need to keep it away from him to support his sobriety.

But his fiance said in front of everyone that she didn't like one of the things that came with the gift and that it would be a hassle to find a place to put ""the whole thing"" (for context, isn't big or bulky or dangerous) I felt very sad and a bit embarrassed. I spoke to some cousins who said they didn't get her anything because she did the same thing to them last Christmas.

&#x200B;

Later, my mother pulled me aside and said she felt sad too. I told her that I was just a bit disappointed, but that it was no big deal. I told her I would just avoid getting them presents in the future, and everyone else had already obviously taken the hint. She was upset to hear this and pointed out that fiance's bridal shower was Christmas Eve morning and everyone would be getting her something. I opted not to go because it is rude to show up without a preset to an event like that, but I also didn't want to be in the position of her telling a bunch of others that she hates the gift I got her. My mother is now mad at me, the fiance has posted some thinly veiled ""everyone hates me"" status on facebook because, apparently, I was not the only one to RSVP no then not send anything, and my brother doesn't seem to want to talk about anything with anyone, saying it would be a ""trigger"" to be stressed with family stuff, ever, so we need to keep it away from him to support his sobriety. Mom, brother, and his fiance all think I'm TA. AITA? I didn't even think anyone would notice I wasn't there, so I am open to being told I am the ass here.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I got my brother's fiance a gift that she said she didn't like. To avoid a repeat, I didn't get her anything for her bridal shower, which was yesterday, and I didn't show up because it's rude to go to an event like that without gifts. AITA?",,

(Barring subreddits dedicated to trans porn ofc)

I'm just not attracted to transgenders, and it's not strictly a physical thing, as some male to female transgenders can be quite attractive, but mentally I just find it off putting sexuality wise.

I am 100% all for trans rights and their ability to do it and for them to have access to all the same things everyone else can access, I just don't find transgenders attractive.

Basically I'm asking if I'm in the wrong for A: Not finding transgenders attractive, and B: Wanting to be warned when they're in nsfw media and such?

I'm sorry if this is poorly formatted but I'm pretty sure I got my point across.

EDIT:

Okay well after reading through the responses, I think I know for sure what my problem is, and it's that I don't understand how they think, because Women and Men are fundamentally different mentally and they will approach things differently even if a man and woman had the exact same upbringing, so it bothers me that does a transgender still think like the sex they changed from? Would a trans male to female still think on a male level? Because it's like this for me, they may be a female or male physically, but mentally do they think like a male or female? I think if A trans male to female had a near exact biology to a female, I don't think have a problem with it, but as far as trans technology is today I don't think I would personally be comfortable dating a transgender.

Still unsure if I'm justified in that though lol, I'm just a bit more sure what my problem is.

My wife and I enrolled our 4 year old son in art classes at the local art museum for the summer. I drop him off in the morning, and have trouble finding parking as the museum neighbors the zoo which is in high gear. Often, I have to park far away and trudge in with my son and carrying his little brother. There is no sidewalk in this parking lot so often we are walking across the lawn of the park which separates the museum and zoo. I noticed parents parking temporarily in the yellow loading zone, one of those ones with striped yellow lines that are next to the handicapped parking and parallel the sidewalk that curves around the parking lot driveway. [Edit - there is no signs in this zone] They park there, walk in with their kids, and then walk out and drive away. It probably takes 5 minutes altogether.

One morning, I decided to do the same and parked behind a parents vehicle that was already there, as I had seen others do. I noticed a man who I thought was a parent loitering around the vehicle in front of me, that I thought was his, and looking at it in an annoyed way. I waved at him as I brought my son to his class. 

On my way out, the same man drove by (don't know if this is relevant, but in a nice white convertible) my (old beat up) truck and yelled at me that I was being inconsiderate parking there. I took his point to be that I was blocking traffic, which we weren't as we were in the loading zone and cars could pass us by. 

I shouted back ""Thank you, have a nice day"" probably a little sarcastic. He stopped his vehicle in the middle of the road, which was definitely blocking traffic, and we got into a little bit of a verbal altercation. 

It never approached anything physical, although he did call me a punk and said I was lucky he didn't get out of his car.

Asking bc a different friend was in abusive relationship with a pedo who USED to be friends w us all but we ditched that scumsucker and got him banned from the site he used to pick up minors. im scared im breaking into Creep Territory and in general am scared of turning into pedo ex-friend so now im super fucking touchy and easily triggered abt age gaps and boundaries like photos even if theyre just normal selfies.

please take note hes the only one ive saved photos of due to reasons alr stated so it feels like im doing smth super wrong even if hes aware i have them saved (he hasnt asked me to delete them tho im worried he hasn't asked me to out of shyness/awkwardness/etc)",,

The problem is that when you are not home, she comes out and lays on all of the furniture and pees on it. We have taken her to the vet several times and spent thousands of dollars on her. There isn’t a  medical solution, she is incontinent. 

For the most part, she likes to be alone. My husband feels guilty that she is alone downstairs. But I contend that she has food and a safe space to live in a controlled setting where if she pees on something, that it isn’t a big deal. He is upset that I don’t go and spend more time with her downstairs to interact. I admit that I don’t do what I should,  but my husband doesn’t either, and his reasoning for not going down there is that “there isn’t anything to do down there”.   I told my husband that she is fine to come upstairs and be allowed to Rome around, if I can replace anything she ruins that she pees on. He then argues that I don’t have a realistic sense of smell. I feel really discounted by this given that I am miserable in areas the cat has been around.

My husband is seriously the love of my life but this freaking cat seems to come between us. Do I need to just accept the smell of cat pee? Am I being a total jerk keeping her In the basement? I love animals and want to make sure she is taken care of, but I am needing help from you guys in establishing what the line is. My husband discounts my experience in smelling all of the cat piss. I feel this is an out for him replacing things she ruins. 

Bahh! What do I do?! Am I the asshole? 

Edit: it is important to note that our basement has finished with carpet and a bathroom. We have a car genie that is the litter box which we check daily. My mother I law is doing a basement remodel which will leave the cat with a very large room but a window well that is north facing. Not ideal since it is a bit darker but we leave some lights on. Again, this is a huge room though with tons of places to roam. ",1550733838.0,3,17.0,0,"AITA because of a freaking cat?!

 It just feels weird getting money involved. I do think he will thank me when he's older. I wish my parents were a little tougher on me.

We got out of the store together and he told me in passing he was sure the woman had fancied him. I told him ""haha I don't believe you"". He said that yes, he was sure of it and that her blushing and looking down was very obvious, and that he was certain that if he would've asked her for a drink she would've said yes. I replied ""if you say so but I still don't believe you"". He said I may not believe it and that I fundamentally think he's ugly but that he's always had a way of seducing women. 


Why I think I'm the asshole: I may have insulted him when I said I didn't believe him. I shouldn't have challenged him. I honestly admit I didn't believe the girl liked him because she was younger and he's older and they had completely different styles. I'm very attracted to my bf but I don't think he's ""conventionally"" attractive. 


Why I think he's the asshole: what he said kinda hurt and made me feel insecure about us. We're long distance finally hanging out, he was in that bookstore to look for a book for me. I was waiting for him talking to that clerk and when he comes back he says that. He said something later about how I don't need to worry because you don't go from having a little chemistry with someone to instantly sleeping with them and he wasn't interested in her.

The person in question, who I'll refer to as D, has backed out before then suddenly wants to go. Ok, fine. I buy the tickets, book the hotel room and work out the fine details.

Cut to 2 days ago, I get told by our mutual friend, G, that they're planning on leaving at 6PM due to work. Ok, cool. I'm annoyed but whatever.  I have family in this town that I want to see, and the only time available is sometime tonight (Friday, day 1 of our trip. I'm in our hotel room waiting for something to happen as I type this). I message our group chat so they know I'm here, we're checked in and their room keys are at the desk in case I'm not here. 

D springs that he's bringing ""A friend"" (that's literally what he said) not only on me, but G as well. I freaked out because I worked really hard to plan this and don't like sudden changes to plans l I'm keeping this, and don't want to be stuck in the same room as a total stranger. 

D said he's playing his part and it's not a big deal, and doesn't understand why I'm not comfortable with that.

AITA for basically blowing up and telling him that it's not cool for him to spring shit like that on me last minute?

UPDATE AND FOLLOWUP AITA

The weekend went horribly. D treated me like total shit the whole time (complained when I got sick and didn't want to go out (they went out without me), the wait time at a restaurant I suggested, and then called me going to a candy store that sells retro candy to get some for my mom stupid) and G didn't step in and say anything. I ended up hiding in the candy stores bathroom and crying because I was so miserable. 

I decided I was done. Told G that I didn't feel wanted by them and was going home, said bye to him, and drove the 4 hours back to my city. They stayed well into the night and the only times I talked to G was letting him know I was home, and him doing the same. D apparently didn't even realize I was leaving until he saw me walking back towards my car.

I haven't spoken to them since, and I'm kind of refusing to speak to D until he apologizes to me (which part of me knows will never happen)
