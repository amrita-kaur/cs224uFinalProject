 My Fiancé and i have been together for 6 years, dating 5, engaged 1. 

I'm currently 14 days late, and sicker than a dog that's eaten chocolate. 

Earlier this week my Fiancé (22M) noticed my lack of period and reminded me that we ran out of protection for 3 days at the end of last month, he did it so calmly that I hadn't realized what he was implying. 

I thought ""huh that's weird but oh well christmas shopping needs done"" and went on about my life as status quo. 

This where the asshole question comes into play.

I'm a smoker, outside and but often, and with my stomach and the holidays stressing me out I'm up to quarter a pack a day, my Fiancé wakes up to me chilling on the porch calm as a cucumber and minding my own business, and starts screaming about smoking while pregnant. 

I'm not and I told him just as much, but it sadly doesn't end there. 
He starts accusing me of not taking a test because I hate children, and saying I'm ignoring the obvious.

I inform him of the following important tid-bits

A) I have Endo and Crohn's, my stomach is always a mess.

B) I'm a grown women, I know my body.

C) I wouldn't be keeping it even if that was the ""problem""

I'm a student with big plans that don't include unplanned children, I've never hidden this fact.

He thinks I'm TA for not ""caring enough to take a test"", potentially harming his unborn son and not considering what he wants for my life and my body.

My friends are split between me being totally right, and me being in denial and inconsiderate so I figured I'd leave it all to y'all.

TLDR: Am I the asshole for knowing my body and not wasting a dollar to confirm nor deny his accusations?

She didn't back down and kept telling me to ""fuck off to another seat"". I probably would have done so had I not been carrying quite a heavy bag, but in this instance it was very inconvenient especially since it had been a few minutes since I'd put my bag down.

She proceeds to tell me that her boyfriend will ""beat me up"" if I don't move right now, and to that I laughed, reminding her that I'd be getting off before I even see this boyfriend of hers, so I tell her to fuck off.

6 years ago, when I got my first phone, she always grabed my phone and searches through my messages with my friends. I confronted her and told her that this makes me feel that she doesn't trust me. She told me that all mothers do this to protect their kids and that it has nothing to do with not trusting me and as a kid I believed her.
1 year later I locked my phone, she asked me about it and I told her that I prefer not to tell her the password because my friends share their secrets with me and it's not right for her to know about it. She told me that she understands and that she prefers to keep it unlocked in case that she needs something, as a kid I believed her again.
I started noticing that she opened WhatsApp and Facebook and (my phone kept track of everything that I opened with time). I asked her and she said that this is for my safety.
I didn't buy it this time and I told her to stop reading my messages and that I'm keeping the password.
She screamed at me and said that I am not honest with her and that I'm hiding something.

I study really hard as I want to have a decent job and a good life, but she thinks that 3 hours a day in church is better for me that 3 hours studying.

Not long ago I was having a free day (I do that once every month and I don't study in it) she came to the room, started screaming at me and told me how much of a disappointment I am and how much my siblings are better than me and my cousins and literally anyone she knew.

His company recently landed a large account which means he's been doing a few months of really intense work, staying late every evening and going into the office on weekends. We've been lucky to see each other once a week if that. We had planned to get together after he finished at the office last Friday. There was a conference call scheduled to end at 6, and he said he'd see me after that, we'd go out and then spend the night at his place.

I was really looking forward to it because, while not totally uncommon, going weeks without time together does strain our relationship. And I know how hard he's been working, so I took the time to come up with some ideas for our date night with him in mind, which included picking up his favourite wine and some dessert for when we got back to his. Anyways, I text him close to the end of his meeting and ask him when he wants to meet up and what he's in the mood for, and don't hear back until 7 pm. At that point, he tells me he'll see me around 9:30/10. I got angry -- I haven't complained once about his long hours -- and told him to forget it. He had the whole evening free but wanted to decompress and go to the gym and didn't think to let me know earlier. We've since talked about it, and he said I shouldn't have been angry because we would still have seen each other and that I definitely shouldn't have cancelled our date night because he was looking forward to it and was disappointed.

My wife’s mother was mentioned because she had passed away and my grandma was also mentioned as well.  My step-mother’s mom had also passed away but wasn’t mentioned.  We didn’t chose to not mention her because of any ill reasons but because we would have been there all day if we were to list off everyone. We simply picked 1 person each side of the families and proceeded to say “and everyone else that contributed to us being here today”.  My step-mom was irate that my grandma was picked over her mom. She proceeded to go to the reception afterwards and completely act like an asshole all night. She refused to participate in any dancing, eating, or pictures.  I wasn’t aware that she was acting like this because I was occupied with pictures, dancing, and socializing with everyone there.  Towards the end of the night I stepped outside with my best man to have a cigar and   recapped the day but that was when she cornered me to tell me that it was bullshit that my grandma was mentioned over her mom. That it was disrespectful of me to chose my mom’s family over hers. I was completely blown away by what she had said. I explained that it wasn’t meant to be disrespectful or a slight to anyone that we didn’t mention. She wouldn’t hear a word of what I was saying, I was simply in the wrong to her and that was final.

We haven’t spoken to this day. Even when my paternal grandfather passed away. She wouldn’t come anywhere near me then.  My dad said that she makes his life a living hell everyday because of what happened.

My maternal grandfather was not invited to wedding due to the fact that he was the cause that my grandma passed away.  His presence would have caused many people not to stay or even show up to my wedding. I despise that man and openly admit it that I hate him.

My mom’s sisters caused a scene by getting drunk prior to the reception and getting into a fight in the parking lot. Security had to be called to escort them off the property.

Backstory:
A few years ago my mum started believing in conspiracy theories, went from pretty open minded to racist and started sharing populist thoughts basically saying stuff like ""there's a NWO organisation, Merkel is the granddaughter of Hitler, the white population is being infiltrated by non-whites and its being replaced by those filthy immigrants"" etc. etc.
This of course caused many arguments and disparities between her and the rest of the family since we all tend to be open minded and think that these kinds of thoughts are just complete and utter bullshit.

Now onto the main part:
A few months ago after my mum got diagnosed with cancer and after my stepdad at that time left her she started dating this guy who's sharing these thoughts as well if not even a tad bit more extreme. For example I know that he's a flat earther and doesn't like the way our system works, especially the school system since the kids are being ""indoctrinated the wrong thoughts and are being teached unnecessary shit"".

I'm 19, my sister is 15 and has never been particularly good in school.

My mum obviously doesn't want to have any of that ""indoctrination"" in state schools being pressed into her kids head, that's why she took her out. 
We argued a lot about this decision since I suspect that my sister will just use the time outside school to not do anything and therefore loosing contact to how the real life is, not getting a degree and not being able to not make anything out of herself. 

I and others from my family also fear that she'll try teaching my sister things that are coming from her reality. Things like those mentioned above, that the holocaust wasn't real and the allies faked it and that the talk about climate change is a huge scam caused by idk who.

I'm having thoughts of reporting my sisters absence and my worries to authorities which would mean that my sis would be forced to go to school and I'd probably be dead for my mother since I betrayed her.

One of my (19f) dear and close friends (19m) takes part in a drama group of our campus. He just started last summer and honestly, he's really good considering he never seriously did theatre plays before. He also says it helps him a lot with school stress which is always good.

Anyhow, this is a small and relatively new group. They've only been in one competition in the last two years. It's also disorganized since it has bunch of different people with their own personal obligations. My friend always makes fun of their inability to agree about rehearsal and complains about the incompetence of some members who're literally just another person's friend or a cousin.

Well here's the thing, they recently did a short French play ""The Chairs"" and I came to watch it. Most of the audience was friends, family, classmates of the students in the group. My friend was really good if you ask me because he actually put in effort, but the play looked rushed and disorganized. A lot of the people forgot their lines or just didn't know how to understand them, so there were some awkward silences.

Some of us classmates hung out later and people started commenting the play. One girl pointed out how some actors just basically didn't understand their lines. Nobody disagreed so I joked that there's a lot of nepotism in that group (half of them being cousins, friends) and that's why they don't even try to be good.

I probably said that weirdly because my friend got mad. He told me later in private that it's embarassing for me to criticize him and his friends so openly, and that I should tell him one-on-one about these opinions. So he thinks I was referring to him in the nepotism part because one of the people in the group is his best friend. That's not true, I think he's one of the best actors but he's not convinced now, he thinks it was a passive-aggressive comment. I think he's also angry because I said that while the guy he likes was in the room, but that's just my guess.

Anyway AITA? It seems like this turned into a situation where my friend thinks he can poke fun at his fellow group members and the whole dynamics but because I did it that was over the line.

Background: My (29F) partner (31M) works in finance and his workload sometimes becomes untenable. I’ll step in and do some of his work for him but when it’s more than what you would do for a friend ie being a second pair of eyes or what you would consider academic dishonesty in school, I ask that I be paid for my time.There hasn’t been objections so far from him but some of my friends think I’m TA for asking because we have been dating for almost three years and I should support him/we are a team/I shouldn’t even be asking in the first place. Some think it’s gross that I’m charging money for my time when we’re supposed to be a team.

I personally think I should be compensated for my time since the work I’m doing requires quantitative expertise and I value my time and abilities. Another point that may or may not be relevant is that he has received huge bonuses in the past and though I can’t attribute it directly to the work I do for him I do think that the sheer volume of his work done is higher than others so that has bumped his comp up significantly. I had asked for the work I do for him be paid prior to this fact.

I was paired up by my teacher with two girls that i don't know very well. Our task was to write a 2 minute speech about the Great Barrier reef dying to the Climate Summit (in french)

One of the girls in my group proposed the idea that our speech should center around the idea that ""if we were mermaids, how would we feel about our home dying around us?"" Her idea for a speech began like this: ""Have you ever thought about being a mermaid?""

The other girl in my group was all for it but i said that since our speech is supposed be held in front of the Climate Summit her idea isn't that suitable for our scenario.

We eventually found a better idea and moved on. 
After the lesson ended the first girl said that since we only have to present our speeches next lesson she wants to take our speech home and finalize it.

The next lesson comes around and the first girl had -with the second girls knowledge- changed the entire speech back to the original mermaid one. I was shocked.

The two girls said that since they wrote the speech i should present it in front of the class. Normally i would have done that but since i never agreed to the actual speech i told them there's no way i would do it. So both of them presented it and it was a shitshow.

As time has progressed and we are now firmly in our 30's, I've become much more affected by her behavior.  Over the years, here are some of the behaviors I've come to loathe:

1. Will get drunk 4-5 nights a week when she is at her parents lake house (So approx 4 months a year)
2. She's had some embarrassing scenes over the years, falling down in public, needing to be carried to bed, getting kicked out of a bar for intoxication.
3. Got hammered 2 Christmas's ago and doesn't remember any of the family traditions or the evening in general
4. Crashed a neighbors party hammered and had to be escorted out
5. Got kicked out of a concert for public intoxication

These events span 3-4 years, so not all at once.

I've become fairly cold and disconnected.  I count her drinks, dread nights out and generally feel very trapped as any event that should be fun could be tainted by her drinking.  I dwell on these things and have a hard time forgiving her.

The other night I finally sat her down and told her if she can't stop driving, it's over.  She went on a tirade about how everything is always all about me and what I want and how I always want to change her.  I didn't really have an argument, I do want to change her, and this is something I want.

A bit of background first, I (19M) started university in September and moved into accommodation for students where I got 3 other random flatmates. 2 of which I get on with but 1, I'll call S, doesn't really speak to us much and spends most of his time in his room playing loud music. S makes no attempt to get to know the people he is living with. 

Fast forward a few weeks, I finish uni and try and get some sleep as I have work in the morning to be woken up by loud banging and shouting at about 3am. I work early shifts so I was not impressed. In the morning, I go to make breakfast to see that S had brought some friends over while drunk and had stacked up all of the kitchen stuff they could into the corner of the room. Like they literally unplugged the microwave (something that is owned by the accommodation, so if it's broken the 4 of us will get a fine) and carefully balanced it on top of the pile. I was quite pissed off but quickly got ready for work and set off because I have early shifts. When I got home the mess was sorted out so I thought nothing of it. People do stupid stuff for a laugh when they're drunk I get it haha. What really annoyed me was what my flatmates found the next day. They also tried moving the fridge but failed to do so. However, they did unplug it and lots of food went bad.

Skip to the Saturday just gone. I was working both Saturday and Sunday and S had friends over on both days. Saturday night I go in to see the entire room had been hotboxed (for those who don't know, that's when the doors and windows are shut and blocked so that the room is filled with smoke). They weren't just smoking tobacco by the smell either. Since they were all drinking too, I couldn't talk to them since they were so out of it, if you know what I mean. Sunday morning I go in the kitchen to see a similar sight. Sock still covering smoke alarm, beer bottles/cans all over the floor etc. There was rubbish all over the sides too since the bin was full. I changed the bag for the bin. I saw that S had left a lot of stuff laying around the kitchen such as phone chargers, extensions for cables and stuff like that. I just grabbed it and put it all in the trash. I knew talking to S would do nothing as I've tried in the past but he just replies with ""sure"". What made it worse was the fact that they had eaten some of our food that night too. Just straight up stolen from the fridge. There were kinda a few not so cheap things I threw away like the phone chargers but S clearly has no respect for us. I've thought about reporting him and I think I will soon.

Well today at work my manager out of desperation asked if i could cover an 11-5 shift because absolutely no one else was able to without way over working one guy.  I hesitated but accepted, knowing that this would cut into our time because:

1. i like my manager becuase she has accommodated for us in the past, giving me days off to spend with my girlfriend even if they were busy times, so I felt morally obligated to help her out.
2. we've done the same exact thing in the past where i've had to work one day of the two day visits and she usually tries to get some work done and sometimes comes visits me where I comp her food.

well when I told her I was sorry but this had to happen she blew up.  Demanded that i fix it by telling work nevermind I couldn't.  I didnt feel this was right so I talked to my manager about possibly switching it and theres nothing really she could do.

I now have my GF calling me repeatedly to get me to respond to her texts and threatening that she will make my life hell if i dont fix it. saying ive ruined everything even though that monday shift would take up less than a 6th of our time that weekend not even counting that I'll see her multiple times during the week.

61059,61059,d107cq,1567883407.0,WIBTA if I move out and leave my family with no source of income?,"Throwaway account.

Ok so a bit of backstory, my (24F) father (50M) passed away last year. He was the sole source of income in my family, and he had some money saved bc he had a lot of health issues. When this happened everyone in my family was already over 18. 

My older brother (25M) lived with him and worked for him, after my father's death he disappeared and spent all the savings in about a month (no idea if he was robbed, made a lot of bad choices, was malicious or just had a mental breakdown), we picked him up in another state after he called us from a public phone and looked like he had been living in the streets for a while, he was, and maybe still is, a drug addict. He now works and lives with us but he only gives a small amount of money to my mom and does not contribute to household expenses. He finished high school and dropped out of college.

My mom (49F) lived from the money my dad sent us, she did not want to work and believed she would live of of the pension and live insurance. She was in a bad state mentally after he passed and refused to believe he was dead, she also blew through the small amount of money she could recover. She 100% believes in witchcraft and wants to live of of that, she contributes sometimes with expenses but refuses to get a job.

My younger brother (18M) helps around the house,  my mom didn't want my younger siblings to work so he helps her in cleaning and anything else she wants. Neither him nor my sister finished high school bc of my father death, last month I finally managed to get their documents and singed them up for online classes. He is in the process of looking for a job.

My sister (18F) was so spoiled that she is strictly forbidden from working because she cannot fend for herself in the real world. So, again, no job.

Finally there's me, I started working a month before my dad passed and am in the process of getting my engineering degree. My commute to work is 1.5 hours each way, I pay for food and services (electrical bill, internet, streaming, etc.) as well as any other unexpected bill. My income is quite low and with how much I spend in transport alone I'm not living comfortably. I'm usually too tired to do anything but shower, eat and go to sleep (usually really late bc I have insomnia). I've stated multiple times that I want to move closer to work so I have more time for myself, no one stops me but they don't try to help me either.

I feel guilty bc I don't want them to suffer, specially my younger siblings, and paying rent would limit how much I can help them. I know they have no way to support themselves right now.

Me and my ex are splitting, finding new places as of 7/1. We both have lots of respect for each other. He is an amazing father to our daughter and I give him nothing but props for that.

The sticky shit comes into our income, me (32 F), make a bit more than him (33 M), as such I have had to bare a lot more of the financial burden, despite him reassuring me in the beginning of our relationship that I would never have to carry him.  This became an issue and, as far as I believe, became the thing that ended our relationship. 

Fast forward...we are both mature adults and love our child very much. She is and will alway be the most important thing to us, so we get along fairly well. His bithday is this weekend. I thought for a send off we would do something for his birthday. 

He picked dinner and a strip club. No problem. We both were not super hungry so we went to a local bar and grabbed a few drinks and an app. I paid for the whole tab. Then went to the strip club, I took out 200 and gave him 60 in cash for singles, I paid for covers and drinks. I also bought him 2 private dances.

I ran out of cash, when I went to the ATM despite having money in my account the ATM said I had ""exceeded my withdraw limit"" so I could not get any more cash. I told him we had a few options. 1) we Uber (we had both been drinking) to the nearest location of my bank and hope the ATM there lets me take out more, or 2) we go home because I was out of cash. He then tells me he has $100 he can spare in his account and to just Venmo me later. 

This kinda triggers me and let me explain why. For my 30th (my last BD) he paid me back for tickets to a concert and called this his present. I honestly don't really like the band, but he does. He begged me to buy tickets to this show for weeks and just because it was close to my birthday he presented it as his birthday present to me. Honestly I felt cheated of my 30th. So I paid 100% for a trip to NYC to see a show I actually wanted to see, including food/hotel/ticket for us both. 

I cried most of the Uber home, which I paid for,  I just feel used. He hasn't spoken to me since (just a few hours, but still, idk).

 Usually the guys Ash meets are from friends or blind dates and she likes to have me there as backup incase the guy is a creep. I genuinely don’t mind doing this. For the double date part she says it feels less awkward if I’m also “on a date” so Ashley usually finds a guy for me to go with or I bring a friend.

So I [22M] have a 5yo daughter. Her mum and I aren't together any more, but we share custody 50/50 (she does a week at mum's, a week at mine, so on). Today, I took she and my little stepbrother [12M] to the cinema to to and see Toy Story 4. After we came out of the film, my little girl started complaining that she needed the toilet really badly. She claimed she'd needed to go for ages but didn't want to miss any of the film so she held it. 

This particular cinema is a very small independent local one, and it doesn't have any kind of ""family bathroom"" or gender neutral option available. Now, in this situation I'd usually just nip my daughter into one of the cubicles of the men's toilets. Except here's the issue; there's only one stall in this men's room at this cinema, and my brother had seen when he'd been in before the film that it was out of order.

Been lurking on reddit for ages without an account, finally made one for this post. 

So I [22M] have a 5yo daughter. Her mum and I aren't together any more, but we share custody 50/50 (she does a week at mum's, a week at mine, so on). Today, I took she and my little stepbrother [12M] to the cinema to to and see Toy Story 4. After we came out of the film, my little girl started complaining that she needed the toilet really badly. She claimed she'd needed to go for ages but didn't want to miss any of the film so she held it. 

This particular cinema is a very small independent local one, and it doesn't have any kind of ""family bathroom"" or gender neutral option available. Now, in this situation I'd usually just nip my daughter into one of the cubicles of the men's toilets. Except here's the issue; there's only one stall in this men's room at this cinema, and my brother had seen when he'd been in before the film that it was out of order. I asked if she could hold it til we got home, and she said no. Obviously I didn't want her to wet herself, so I told her to run into the ladies really quick and I would wait right outside.

She is an extremely thoughtful and caring partner and I'm so glad she'll be with me to celebrate my 30th birthday in February. 

I don't like to set people up for failure and told her explicitly this was an important birthday and that I wanted a day activity and dinner date. I'm always the one who plans our outings whereas she's more effective at beautifying our house and in general just being thoughtful and wonderful. I gave her the heads up because I just don't want to be disappointed but I could tell there was some hesitation / unsuredness around how to treat my birthday. Fast forward to last night and she's sounding out some ideas to me via text. I can tell she's putting some thought into what our activity will be and this makes me extremely happy. As we're discussing what the day is going to look like she goes on to warn me that ""One more thing, that's the day my brother passed away and I may be sad that day."" This kinda threw me but I wrote to her I was sorry and that we should do something to remember him by. She then responded ""No that's okay, I post one picture of him every year on insta but I'm usually sad all day"".

Now this is where I ask AITA here for feeling annoyed? The timing is shitty and she's fully entitled to feeling sad on this day but warning me she's going to be in a funk dampens any excitement I had about my birthday. Her brother died 10 years ago and from what I understand she barely saw him growing up due to divorce and long distances. That sounds petty writing out but I know for a fact they weren't close. Still she's a sensitive person and I'm sure her feelings of sadness are genuine. Am I being totally insensitive here? 

Edit: Thanks for the perspective everyone. Some of it was hard to read but all valid criticism. I spoke with her this morning and suggested rescheduling festivities till the week after but apparently the arrangements are set and she'd rather proceed. I in turn will be mindful of the significance this day holds for her and will be supportive, as well as, certainly making sure we celebrate on a alternative day next year. This post certainly served it purpose. Cheers. 

Edit: For the record, I in no way expressed any of my internal conflict to my partner either through words or body language. She was quite surprised when I suggested rescheduling the day for the reasons I provided and was moved by the ""thoughtfulness"" - which you guys know is undeserved.

I (19M) am currently staying in a house with me, My mother, her husband (my stepfather) and her husbands mother (my Step-grandmother, who we'll call L). L is 86 and is definitely feeling her age, she is fairly immobile and uses 2 walking sticks to get around places. She goes out a fair bit to do standard hobbies that old people do (bingo, gardening that kind of thing) but most of her time during the day consists of her watching TV and moving over to the kitchen to make food. This is where it gets kind of tricky.

L is in the kitchen ALL the time, and by all the time I mean she is ALWAYS there making food or a cup of tea or something. This makes it incredibly hard to do your own thing in the kitchen because, as previously mentioned, L is quite immobile and so it takes forever for her to finish what she's doing. Both me and my Mother get pretty frustrated at this.

My Mother works 12 hour shifts throughout the week and so when she comes home and sees that L is making food or a cup of tea and that she won't be able to do anything in the kitchen until she's done she gets very frustrated. 

She also gets frustrated because L also kind of assumes that my Mother is going to go shopping for her or take her to her Doctor appointments on her days off. Like she'll just be like ""I've wrote a shopping list for you"" or ""My appointment is at x time"" and because my Mother is such a kind soul she won't refuse but instead just do it without question and get frustrated about it. 

What's also frustrating is that L won't wait for people to be done before she comes into the kitchen, she has a VERY specific schedule for what time she eats and so if someone is in there at that time she will come in and start doing her thing and quite frankly just get in the way of what you're trying to do. It's frustrating to the point where I'll just straight up leave the kitchen until she's done before I continue.

It's worth mentioning that L is a very nice lady but that there's just some I guess 'unspoken conflict' between who is in what space at what time. So my question to you Reddit is: WIBTA if I were to talk about this with L to try and make things a little less frustrating for my Mother and I?

It was a surprise to me because they have only been dating a few months. It also turns out that they hadn’t had a discussion about it yet, so nothing was set in stone, but she assured me it was a done deal.

I started to look for a roommate and, luckily for me, one of my best friends from uni moved back to my area and started to look for a place. I told her my situation and she said it would be a good idea to live together again.

This worked out perfectly for everyone because my roommate could move out and my friend could move in with no hard feelings.

My [24f] friend/roommate [25F] told me about 2.5 weeks ago she wants to move out and live with her boyfriend, after I had said that I wanted to renew the lease — after being promoted by our landlord to discuss it. It was a surprise to me because they have only been dating a few months. It also turns out that they hadn’t had a discussion about it yet, so nothing was set in stone, but she assured me it was a done deal.

I started to look for a roommate and, luckily for me, one of my best friends from uni moved back to my area and started to look for a place. I told her my situation and she said it would be a good idea to live together again.

I live with my BF (32M) who works FT in retail. When not at work, he's on his computer. Because I'm home all day, I agreed to take on more chores. But we both agreed that cleaning shouldn't be my full responsibility.

A few years ago, the roles were reversed and he was the unemployed one, at home playing video games. I was working two jobs to make ends meet for us. He didn't help too much with chores then either (because we had a third roommate who loved cleaning).

Here's how it goes: I'll mention about wanting us to get some cleaning done tomorrow and he agrees. The next day comes and we wake up, chill out for a couple hours, and then I slowly start making my way to cleaning. He'll still be sitting at his comp. I'll mention something in passing like, ""do you mind doing the dishes"" or ""could you take care of your pile of clean clothes in the bedroom"" or ""do you mind changing the water in your fish tank"" (because I'm so small so I really struggle picking up the buckets of water that high and stuff AND ITS HIS TANK -- fish keep dying because he won't take care of it) and he just goes BANANAS! 

""*Sigh* okay yeah fine but *I work all day* I really just wish you did this stuff while I'm at work""

What I do for chores:
- our laundry 
- clean the bathroom
- vacuum
- clean 2 other fish tanks
- take care of our bird
- dust
- de-clutter

What he does for chores:
- water changes on the large tank
- he mopped the kitchen last week

We agree to swap dishes duty every-other time. But when it's his turn, he'll let the sink pile with dishes on both sides for days until it smells and we have no dishes. And even then, he's asked me in the past, ""what do I need to do to make you take my turn haha"" or sometimes he'll do only half of them at a time, let it pile up again, and the cycle continues for a couple weeks. And sometimes he leaves the ickiest ones on the bottom and say he ""can't deal with the smell"" and asks me to finish them. 

After he's done moaning and groaning through a chore or two, he sits back in front of his comp and vapes while I'm still running around trying to clean the place. If I ask him to do another thing it's a big *sigh* as he gets up to go do it and says again ""I work all week and my back/shoulder hurts."" 

While cleaning last week, my boyfriend told me at least twice ""you don't need to make it that clean in here jeez"" My blood boils just thinking about it. What the fuck is wrong with a house that's clean? Our apartment itself is already a dumpy place. I also have MDD and the clutter makes me feel 10x worse.

64978,64978,d8le7d,1569321781.0,AITA for getting my brother a mop for his bday?,"I (18F) was home from uni, and my mum had told me clean the house. I did, and was just going to get some water from the kitchen. My brother(23M) was there refilling his water bottle from the fridge water dispenser. His attention was completely on his phone not the bottle, so it spilled onto the floor and down the sides of the fridge. This is not the first time it happened. 

I told him to clean it up, because i just swept and mopped the house (which he did not help once btw). He said no, its just water. I pressed again because i will not do it. He said no and told me to fuck myself. Ok i told him he’s a POS and went and poured water in front of his bedroom, which he a few hours later did the same back to me. His birthday was in a few days and I was originally thinking of giving him a gift card cos idk what he likes, but i decided to buy a mop because I still wasn’t over his immaturity (still am not). 

The day comes around, its just me and my parents and one family friend at our house. We cut the cake blah blah, time comes around for the presents to be given. I go after the family friend, and its pretty obvious my gift is not the conventional gift bc i wrapped the cloth part(?? The wiping part, not the pole lol) and i just left the pole on its side. 

He opens it, and just stares at it and looks back up at me and asks why i gave him that. I tell him so he can use it to mop the floor next time he spills something because I’m not going to do it. He looks pissed but couldn’t say anything because of the family friend. Parents look confused/angry and family friend looks like she just wants to get out of there. 

After she leaves my parents blow up at me for embarrassing him and them in front of family friend. I tell them about the incident, and they tell me that i should just take care of it since he’s my brother, and that I’m his younger sister so i should obey him??? I tell them that i cleaned the entire house by myself but he cant do one simple thing, and my mum just told me to leave it because my brother is like that and i should just put up with it. 

My brother went and poured more water in front of my bedroom and on my room’s carpet, great!!!. I tell my friend who said that what i did was funny, but my dad and my brother have not spoken to me for a few days and my mum says this is what i get for behaving like that. AITA??


EDIT/ UPDATE:

 Idk why im writing an essay for this but I have to write down my thoughts to this. Anyway thank you everyone for all your replies, it really put me in my place and also put everything else in perspective. It’s not just about spilling some water, its the fact that I cleaned a house that I dont’t even stay at everyday and my brother barely lifted a finger, and then he came and completely disrespected me when I asked him to do a very VERY menial task. Yes i retaliated in an extremely immature way and have understood that I was as equally a dick as my brother. 

I have apologised to him for embarrassing him and got him a Visa card as his real present lol. Although as many suggested I tell him how i felt about his behaviour, I have done this in the past for various other situations and all have backfired on me. He has an unusually big ego, and is extremely traditional so anything I say as a retort to his unreasonable (imo) actions, I guess is an insult to him so he just tells me I have no right to tell him that. 

Whatever,, I leave tomorrow for uni and won’t be coming back for a few weeks so I might as well just brush it under the carpet to leave on a good note. I have also apologised to my dad for embarrassing him, and mostly to mum - she was really sad at the state of our family, so I felt really bad for her. 

My dad, my mum and my brother were all born and raised in India, in very traditional households, so I guess that shows the root of their blatantly backwards mindsets. If I had not cleaned the house, my brother definitely would not have, and that meant my mother would have to do it all by herself, because surprise surprise my dad is the same as my brother. I think I’m her only solace, because she knows she can rely on me to do something, because my dad and brother definitely won’t from what I have lived through. She’s technically in the same boat as I am, she just thinks its okay, since she was raised that way. That’s a whole different problem though. Also I’m not going to cut ties with them - I do try distance myself from my brother and my dad sometimes, because we clash often.

Either way, I’m leaving tomorrow and like some comments have suggested, I am focusing on saving up as much as possible, so I can move out permanently.

My dad and my stepmom very seldom contact me if ever. However, they get upset when I don't contact them back. I spent this summer in a different state visiting my girlfriend and working with her dad at his company. I received 3 texts total from my parents, and no incoming phone calls. I called them twice and texted multiple times. They have always been this way.

Recently, my dad and I were discussing sleeping arrangements if my girlfriend were to visit over thanksgiving.

I had no qualms with my dad's decision, but my dad started texting me sporadically again, and when I called, he sent me to voicemail after two rings. I thought, ""maybe he's just on the phone, I'll call my stepmom."" Same thing. I then called the house phone, and it turns out kids were being put to bed. I asked to call once they were done, and I got the following texts. (M-me, D-dad)

M ""Can I call?""

D ""At this point I am very upset and I don't think it's a good time to call.""

M ""Who are you upset at?""

D ""Good night.""

M ""There's obviously something going on here that I am unaware of, who are you upset at? If it's me, what did I do?""

This isn't the sole reason that I'm considering estranging myself, (that would be extreme), but instead its the last straw.

The first couple of days was fine not problems with eachother at all, but then the first weekend rolled around and she decided to go party with a couple of friends at a MT sorority house. I was fine with it, but I had to go to bed early because I had ME orientation the next day. Later that night she comes back around 3 or 4 am making a lot of noise and is noticeably drunk. This wakes me up and once I'm awake it's really hard to fall back asleep.  The next day she apologizes for waking me up but she was just so drunk she had a hard time staying quiet. I didnt really care at first because this is college and maybe this is her way of adjusting. 

The next weekend rolls around and the same thing happens except this time she went to a baseball party and one of the guys there took advantage of her drunkenness.

However, this year we decided to decline the rent increase due to our landlord not doing any work in our unit since we have moved in, and also ghosting on us when we needed them.

Since I was about 13 our mum started working in the next town over, which requires her leaving at 6am for work, and my sister started going to high school with me, so it became my job to make sure both siblings were awake and going to school.

As college starts at 8am for me, and I have to leave at 7:30, what I've been doing for the last week or so is waking both siblings about 20 minutes before I leave, and checking they're awake 10 minutes later. So I get them up for about 7:10-7:15 and they have to take over from there.

My brother's school is 2 blocks from our house and my sister's school is about 15 minutes away when walking.

My brother is fairly independent, always gets up immediately, can get himself breakfast and get dressed and out the door. He's got his own house key and is capable of locking the door behind him, and a phone to ring me or mum in case of emergencies and let us know he got to school on time.

My sister is another story. She's not a morning person in any sense of the words. I can wake her up, watch her get out of bed, go get herself some cereal, and then I'll go check on her and she's in bed, asleep again. IDK how she does it.

This morning my phone was dead, so my alarm didn't go off. I woke up around 7:45 and had to rush through my morning routine, wake up both siblings right before I left, and barely made it to class on time.

My brother got up immediately, saw the time, and raced through his routine.

I had knocked on my sister's door before I left, and my brother says he yelled for her to get up, but around 9:30 I got a call from my sister asking why no one had woken her, as she was now late for school, and blaming me for not making sure she was up.

I've resolved to get myself a proper alarm clock in case my phone battery ever dies again or for some reason doesn't go off. I'm buying it from a nearby store which is currently doing 3 for 2 on household electronics, including digital alarm clocks.

As we all need to get up at different times, I think it would make sense to buy 3 alarms, one each, and that way everyone can set their clock to whenever they want and I don't have to worry about making sure everyone is up on time.

However, after mentioning this to a friend, I was told that this could very easily be seen as passive aggressive. The friend also pointed out that today was a fluke as this is the first time in 3 years that I've overslept and not had everyone up.

90932,90932,elipma,1578435140.0,WIBTA if I tell my Best Friends Fiance she lied about wanting kids?,"Apologies for format, am on an old cell phone. 

My (31F) best friend (let's called her Anne, 31f) is engaged and getting married this April, I am her Maid of Honor. Her Fiance (let's call him Dan, 33M) is best friends with my BF (who is also supposed to be the Best Man in this Wedding) 
We introduced them almost 5 years ago. 

Dan works for his  family owned business and is quite well off, Anne used to be a Social worker (like myself) but has left this last year to be an ""Instagram Influencer"" which Dan has supported her with, and has been paying for her lifestyle.

A week ago, Anne and I got together with a few friends for wine and dinner. Anne's wedding came up and someone brought up how extravagant the wedding will be, due to Dan and his family being so well off.  She starting laughing and somewhat bragging about Dan (I don't blame her, he is a great guy) and talking about how amazing their lives will be (she had a bit to drink at this point, and was a little tipsy) 

Naturally the topic of Kids came up, and that's where things took a turn. I myself have been apart of many conversations between the two where they have talked about having kids, ( they even have name picked out) and how excited they are to start a family within the first year of marriage, well, I guess it's actually just him that's excited. Anne starts going on about her Instagram career (which she swears will take off soon) and that she has no interest in ruining her body by having kids. I stayed quiet after that.

Later when I was driving her home, I brought it up and asked her when she changed her mind, she then said she never had intentions of having kids and only went along with it to please Dan, hoping he would change his mind eventually and appreciate just it being them. I asked her if she told him, she laughed and said no, I then I asked her if she planned to before they got married, she again said no. I kind of went off at her, saying how she needs to have this discussion before they got married and how dishonest it was, and asked how she planned on getting away with it. She then said she's staying on the pill, and maybe after ""struggling"" to get pregnant, he will change his mind, and then who knows maybe she will change her mind down the line. 

We fought the whole way back to her place, which ended with me telling her she better tell Dan. She called me the next day to ask if that was a threat, and started begging me not to ruin her life. I felt bad and told her I loved her, but that she had no right to go into marriage being deceitful, she then said having a baby is a huge change, and that it's her choice not to ruin her body or lifestyle. I agreed and said it was her body and her choice, however that doesn't mean she gets to lie to Dan about the family and future he thinks he's going to have, and that if she doesn't tell him, I would.

AITA

Edit: also wanted to add that her sister (who is also in the wedding party) came to see me. She told me Anne told me that in confidence, and that I am not a couple's counselor or Anne's therapist so I have no right to be offering threats and opinions about someone else's relationship, and how I should be more sympathetic to Anne's situation.

Edit: so, she told him she got drunk and had a moment where she said she was worried about having kids because her Instagram career was taking off , that I over reacted and twisted the conversation on her and that was threatening her, Dan called my Boyfriend to demand why I would do something like that to Anne, especially when she was clearly just panicking about the future and needed a friend. 

I told my boyfriend everything, how I wanted Anne to have the chance to come clean to Dan first, because I knew if I told him, he would tell Dan himself, I showed him the messages between myself, Anne and her sister to back myself up. He has now sent them to Dan.

Edit: after my BF sent the messages, we never heard back from Dan. My BF then sent a few more asking if everything was alright  before telling him to call us if he needed anything, he got a text back around 3am saying ""Thanks"" 

I just woke up and am no longer apart of the Bridal Party WhatsApp group, and am either blocked across all social media with Anne or she has deleted her accounts ( more then likely the first one though) 

And to answer a question (sorry I didn't go into detail prior) It's not just her body she was worried about, she has no interest in the lifestyle change that comes with being a parent. She wants to just live her life traveling and have fun, not having to worry about putting someone else first, or being judged on the internet (woops) for being conceited if she acted that way if she was a mom.

Edit: My BF and I have talked to Dan, he's pretty torn up and isn't sure how to feel. Somehow Anne has made him feel like he forced her into saying she wanted kids, so now he feels guilty, but also realizes there was no trust as she felt she couldn't tell him this the whole time they were together, he also spoke to his dad who is now convinced she was in it for the money (which I guess he has felt the whole time)

My BF and I told Dan he didn't force her into anything, and that he has nothing to feel guilty about, having Kids or not can be the deal breaker in any relationship, and she took advantage of his desire to start a family, Dan still wants to be with her though as I guess she also started back pedaling when he told her maybe they should call it quits, and gave him the whole "" maybe I will change my mind""  or  ""we could hire a Surrogate or something if you really want one"" 

Dan said the Surrogate thing feels like rich privilege though, and feels wrong considering there are women out there who can't get Pregnant, while as far as he knows, Anne is fine, and feels as though Anne is probably taking advantage of his families wealth.

My BF jokingly him to tell Anne he wants a prenup, and for her to get a real job, and see if she still wants to stay, but Joking aside, he deserves better and that while he will still support him in his choice, his view of her is forever altered with how she treated Dan and myself.

Dan said he has alot to think about, and as of right now Anne is at her mom's.

Edit: Hi everyone, not sure if you will see this as it has been a few days, But Anne and Dan have broken up. She messaged me 2 days ago, going off about how I was always a wolf in sheep skin, that I was jealous of her because I settled for my BF and would of never had a chance with Dan (wtf?) And that she hopes I die. I told her to try be less manipulative next time she finds herself in a relationship and to have a good life.

I guess she posted some sob story to her followers, and finished with how she was going to come out ""stronger"" from this, but that she has to take time away to recollect herself (as in, another way to make money) 

Dan is.... Not doing so good, but my BF is an amazing friend to him and has been doing what he can to help him, Dan feels embarrassed, and I guess his family keeps saying ""I told you so"", so Dan has been burying himself in his work and hanging out with my BF and I

Dan works for his  family owned business and is quite well off, Anne used to be a Social worker (like myself) but has left this last year to be an ""Instagram Influencer"" which Dan has supported her with, and has been paying for her lifestyle.

A week ago, Anne and I got together with a few friends for wine and dinner. Anne's wedding came up and someone brought up how extravagant the wedding will be, due to Dan and his family being so well off.  She starting laughing and somewhat bragging about Dan (I don't blame her, he is a great guy) and talking about how amazing their lives will be (she had a bit to drink at this point, and was a little tipsy) 

Naturally the topic of Kids came up, and that's where things took a turn. I myself have been apart of many conversations between the two where they have talked about having kids, ( they even have name picked out) and how excited they are to start a family within the first year of marriage, well, I guess it's actually just him that's excited. Anne starts going on about her Instagram career (which she swears will take off soon) and that she has no interest in ruining her body by having kids. I stayed quiet after that.

Later when I was driving her home, I brought it up and asked her when she changed her mind, she then said she never had intentions of having kids and only went along with it to please Dan, hoping he would change his mind eventually and appreciate just it being them. I asked her if she told him, she laughed and said no, I then I asked her if she planned to before they got married, she again said no. I kind of went off at her, saying how she needs to have this discussion before they got married and how dishonest it was, and asked how she planned on getting away with it. She then said she's staying on the pill, and maybe after ""struggling"" to get pregnant, he will change his mind, and then who knows maybe she will change her mind down the line. 

We fought the whole way back to her place, which ended with me telling her she better tell Dan. She called me the next day to ask if that was a threat, and started begging me not to ruin her life. I felt bad and told her I loved her, but that she had no right to go into marriage being deceitful, she then said having a baby is a huge change, and that it's her choice not to ruin her body or lifestyle. I agreed and said it was her body and her choice, however that doesn't mean she gets to lie to Dan about the family and future he thinks he's going to have, and that if she doesn't tell him, I would.

AITA

Edit: also wanted to add that her sister (who is also in the wedding party) came to see me. She told me Anne told me that in confidence, and that I am not a couple's counselor or Anne's therapist so I have no right to be offering threats and opinions about someone else's relationship, and how I should be more sympathetic to Anne's situation.

Edit: so, she told him she got drunk and had a moment where she said she was worried about having kids because her Instagram career was taking off , that I over reacted and twisted the conversation on her and that was threatening her, Dan called my Boyfriend to demand why I would do something like that to Anne, especially when she was clearly just panicking about the future and needed a friend. 

I told my boyfriend everything, how I wanted Anne to have the chance to come clean to Dan first, because I knew if I told him, he would tell Dan himself, I showed him the messages between myself, Anne and her sister to back myself up. He has now sent them to Dan.

Edit: after my BF sent the messages, we never heard back from Dan. My BF then sent a few more asking if everything was alright  before telling him to call us if he needed anything, he got a text back around 3am saying ""Thanks"" 

I just woke up and am no longer apart of the Bridal Party WhatsApp group, and am either blocked across all social media with Anne or she has deleted her accounts ( more then likely the first one though) 

And to answer a question (sorry I didn't go into detail prior) It's not just her body she was worried about, she has no interest in the lifestyle change that comes with being a parent. She wants to just live her life traveling and have fun, not having to worry about putting someone else first, or being judged on the internet (woops) for being conceited if she acted that way if she was a mom.

Edit: My BF and I have talked to Dan, he's pretty torn up and isn't sure how to feel. Somehow Anne has made him feel like he forced her into saying she wanted kids, so now he feels guilty, but also realizes there was no trust as she felt she couldn't tell him this the whole time they were together, he also spoke to his dad who is now convinced she was in it for the money (which I guess he has felt the whole time)

My BF and I told Dan he didn't force her into anything, and that he has nothing to feel guilty about, having Kids or not can be the deal breaker in any relationship, and she took advantage of his desire to start a family, Dan still wants to be with her though as I guess she also started back pedaling when he told her maybe they should call it quits, and gave him the whole "" maybe I will change my mind""  or  ""we could hire a Surrogate or something if you really want one"" 

Dan said the Surrogate thing feels like rich privilege though, and feels wrong considering there are women out there who can't get Pregnant, while as far as he knows, Anne is fine, and feels as though Anne is probably taking advantage of his families wealth.

My BF jokingly him to tell Anne he wants a prenup, and for her to get a real job, and see if she still wants to stay, but Joking aside, he deserves better and that while he will still support him in his choice, his view of her is forever altered with how she treated Dan and myself.

Dan said he has alot to think about, and as of right now Anne is at her mom's.

Edit: Hi everyone, not sure if you will see this as it has been a few days, But Anne and Dan have broken up. She messaged me 2 days ago, going off about how I was always a wolf in sheep skin, that I was jealous of her because I settled for my BF and would of never had a chance with Dan (wtf?) And that she hopes I die. I told her to try be less manipulative next time she finds herself in a relationship and to have a good life.

I guess she posted some sob story to her followers, and finished with how she was going to come out ""stronger"" from this, but that she has to take time away to recollect herself (as in, another way to make money) 

Dan is.... Not doing so good, but my BF is an amazing friend to him and has been doing what he can to help him, Dan feels embarrassed, and I guess his family keeps saying ""I told you so"", so Dan has been burying himself in his work and hanging out with my BF and I

Thanks everyone for the comments, I showed Dan this thread and he read it for close to a hour, laughed and said he had no idea Reddit was supportive like this!",31.0,F

So how it happened is that the young kids rush to the back to take the last row. As there’s only 5 sears on the last row it’s basically a first come first served basis. So the rest of the children would have to sit elsewhere in front of them.

So what happened is that the last 2 rows were occupied by children and I was sitting on the third last row with no one next to me.

He then complained that it was because i reclined my seat a bit to lie down and sleep. Of course I told him he could recline his too. This was when I noticed the problem.

The children were arguing because the row at the back couldn’t recline their seats as it was the last row. So they took their frustration out on the children(younger than them) sitting in the row in front of them. And of course this was then taken out on me because I was on the third last row.

This needs some background, and explanation. I'm 16 and my friend is 15, and the Nice guy is 16. I'm very small, and look like a rat, while my friend is attractive and is a magnet for creepy guys. The Nice guy is 6'2, and a football player.

Me- Me

My friend: K

Nice guy: P

So, this starts our freshman year. K and I were taking a first aid class as a health elective, and were enjoying it. We were supposed to practice on CPR dummies today, 1 dummy to 3 people.

People started getting into groups, and by the end of the chaos, P was left without a group. K and i were happy to let him in our group, as most of the guys would try to joke around with him, and end up distracting the rest of the class. it was my turn to act out the situation first.

As soon as i finished, K volunteered to go. Everything went smoothly, K did great with the CPR, but we both noticed something with P.

He was staring directly at her tits as she did CPR on the dummy.

We didn't confront him about it, as we both felt uncomfortable about it, and we didn't want to embarrass him. This was at the end of the year, so we didn't have any problems with him until the start of our Sophomore year.

One of the first days of school, K and I ate in the library with him, and a few mutual friends for lunch. immediately, P turned the subject to mine and K's boob sized and the difference in them, i'm not gonna say the difference. That was the last time we ate with them.

P started eating lunch with us though, and when i casually mentioned my sexuality, bisexual, p immediately says something along the lines of ""So if K was bi, you would be totally into a threesome?""

K is bi, and as soon as she herself mentioned it, weeks later might I add, P says two things, in this exact order.

1. ""i had a feeling having someone gay around you 24/7 would turn you gay K""

and 2) ""So what about that threesome?""

We quickly dismissed the idea, and quickly shifted subjects.

The last incident that actually involved me was when P was getting way to close to K when she was filling up her tea jug at the hot water tank. Like, way too close. Not even a fun-sized bible between them.

So, like that rat I am, squeezed in between them, my front facing him, and shot him the smuggest grin I could. Another note, I jokingly flip my guy-friends hats off, like, as a 100% playful thing. I've done it to P before, and when i did it this time, he flat out threatened to rip my nose ring out.

The most recent incident is when he groped my friend L, who is a freshman. They were joking around, and when L made a comment, i'm not sure what, P got really pissed off, and shoved his hand in her tit, and squeezed.The reason I'm posting this is because i've been told multiple reasons as to NOT report him. here a list.

1. He's a good football player
2. He lacks proper social skills
3. You might ruin his entire life
4. He has depression
5. He has anger issues

This needs some background, and explanation. I'm 16 and my friend is 15, and the Nice guy is 16. I'm very small, and look like a rat, while my friend is attractive and is a magnet for creepy guys. The Nice guy is 6'2, and a football player.

Me- Me

My friend: K

Nice guy: P

So, this starts our freshman year. K and I were taking a first aid class as a health elective, and were enjoying it. We were supposed to practice on CPR dummies today, 1 dummy to 3 people.

People started getting into groups, and by the end of the chaos, P was left without a group. K and i were happy to let him in our group, as most of the guys would try to joke around with him, and end up distracting the rest of the class. it was my turn to act out the situation first.

As soon as i finished, K volunteered to go. Everything went smoothly, K did great with the CPR, but we both noticed something with P.

He was staring directly at her tits as she did CPR on the dummy.

We didn't confront him about it, as we both felt uncomfortable about it, and we didn't want to embarrass him. This was at the end of the year, so we didn't have any problems with him until the start of our Sophomore year.

One of the first days of school, K and I ate in the library with him, and a few mutual friends for lunch. immediately, P turned the subject to mine and K's boob sized and the difference in them, i'm not gonna say the difference. That was the last time we ate with them.

P started eating lunch with us though, and when i casually mentioned my sexuality, bisexual, p immediately says something along the lines of ""So if K was bi, you would be totally into a threesome?""

K is bi, and as soon as she herself mentioned it, weeks later might I add, P says two things, in this exact order.

1. ""i had a feeling having someone gay around you 24/7 would turn you gay K""

and 2) ""So what about that threesome?""

We quickly dismissed the idea, and quickly shifted subjects.

The last incident that actually involved me was when P was getting way to close to K when she was filling up her tea jug at the hot water tank. Like, way too close. Not even a fun-sized bible between them.

So, like that rat I am, squeezed in between them, my front facing him, and shot him the smuggest grin I could. Another note, I jokingly flip my guy-friends hats off, like, as a 100% playful thing. I've done it to P before, and when i did it this time, he flat out threatened to rip my nose ring out.

The most recent incident is when he groped my friend L, who is a freshman. They were joking around, and when L made a comment, i'm not sure what, P got really pissed off, and shoved his hand in her tit, and squeezed.The reason I'm posting this is because i've been told multiple reasons as to NOT report him. here a list.

1. He's a good football player
2. He lacks proper social skills
3. You might ruin his entire life
4. He has depression
5. He has anger issues

Hello, I'm a 20 year old dude that is currently living with my mother. I work full time, but She is somewhat disabled, so I stay with her to do the things she cannot( pretty much everything that requires standing for long durations, kneeling/crouching). 

About a month ago I had a talk with her about her becoming too dependent on me, and that everytime I told her no, she would call me a jerk/asshole or say I didn't care about her. She had begun asking me to do medial things. ( Bring her drinks, find her hairbrush, get her a change of clothes etc....). I'm not ok with that. I have my own things to do, and on my time off I do not want to be constantly called upon to do these types of things. And I definitely do not want to be made to feel guilty after saying no.

 Today when she got home from work, she rattled off a list of things she needed me to do out of nowhere. Bring her a soda, grab her slippers, and bring her a throw blanket. I immediately told her no, and that we've had this discussion and that she needed to get those items herself.

She got very upset with me. I explained to her that she had been doing great for 2 or three weeks there and then for some reason this past week she had completely fallen back into the habit. 

This made her even more angry. She began telling me once again that I do not care, that I'm a jerk, and that now I am being abusive. I don't know where to go from here, but I need some outside opinions so that I can make sure I'm not being unreasonable before I put my foot down again.",1573695210.0,not the asshole,10,22.0,0,"AITA For confronting my mother about the way she treats me?

I have been in yearbook for 2 years. I sit next to this dude that I will call D. D had been hinting about going to prom with ""Did you buy a prom dress?"" and ""Have you bought a ticket?"" I had not because I did not plan to go. I had made plans to hang out with my dudes and play video games and eat Chinese food. It was cheaper and Chinese taste better than Walmart finger foods on a platter. I told him no for about 3 days until IT happened.

Me: Come on guys! We have faces to tag and only a week to do it! (Book was due in a week and they procrastinated. A lot.)
D and T are talking in the closet.

Me: yep
D: What about with me? (Opens the box with a cookie cake saying ""Sbp? Prom?""
Me: D. I told you already I have plans and no interest in prom. No.
The class breaks out in anger. They say stuff like ""You should just say yes!"" and ""Wow don't be so mean about it!"" 
He knew I made these plans for months BECAUSE I INVITED HIM TO JOIN US! 
Me: T I am out! I am hiding in the bathroom, Good bye! 
I waved and walked out.

I go into the bathroom across the school and find R1 and R2 hiding in there. We chat as I know them pretty well and they basically agree that I shouldn't go if I do not want to, but should maybe think about it. T walks in and tells me how D is ""heartbroken"" and that I should think about it and say yes. I say that I am not going with him; she says it is my decision and mine only.

I pop my head in the door to find them talking about hair. Of all things why hair? So I listen to stories of fake hair and sit down.

D: so did you change your mind?
Me:No. I told you I had plans and you knew that.
D: just cancel them and come to prom with me!
Me: No, but you can join me.
D: Why won't you just cancel your plans? You could hang out with them anyday but you can come to prom with me once!

He texted his friends and family I said no
Me: I would love to see her try.
D: and my mom said she won't buy bacon from you!

I have been in yearbook for 2 years. I sit next to this dude that I will call D. D had been hinting about going to prom with ""Did you buy a prom dress?"" and ""Have you bought a ticket?"" I had not because I did not plan to go. I had made plans to hang out with my dudes and play video games and eat Chinese food. It was cheaper and Chinese taste better than Walmart finger foods on a platter. I told him no for about 3 days until IT happened.

Me: Come on guys! We have faces to tag and only a week to do it! (Book was due in a week and they procrastinated. A lot.)
D and T are talking in the closet.
D:(brings out a flat white box and everyone whips out their phones) So Sbp? Are you still not going to prom.
Me: yep
D: What about with me? (Opens the box with a cookie cake saying ""Sbp? Prom?""
Me: D. I told you already I have plans and no interest in prom. No.
The class breaks out in anger. They say stuff like ""You should just say yes!"" and ""Wow don't be so mean about it!"" 
He knew I made these plans for months BECAUSE I INVITED HIM TO JOIN US! 
Me: T I am out! I am hiding in the bathroom, Good bye! 
I waved and walked out.

I go into the bathroom across the school and find R1 and R2 hiding in there. We chat as I know them pretty well and they basically agree that I shouldn't go if I do not want to, but should maybe think about it. T walks in and tells me how D is ""heartbroken"" and that I should think about it and say yes. I say that I am not going with him; she says it is my decision and mine only.

I pop my head in the door to find them talking about hair. Of all things why hair? So I listen to stories of fake hair and sit down.

D: so did you change your mind?
Me:No. I told you I had plans and you knew that.
D: just cancel them and come to prom with me!
Me: No, but you can join me.
D: Why won't you just cancel your plans? You could hang out with them anyday but you can come to prom with me once!
Me: I said no!
D: Well girl said you are a horrible person for telling me no and your little sister said she was gonna hurt you.
He texted his friends and family I said no
Me: I would love to see her try.
D: and my mom said she won't buy bacon from you!
Me: and (I was selling fundraisers for clubs) 
D: Just cancel your plans

The rest of the day is filled with evil glares and shoulder checks.

Our last hour comes and I walk out of the class with my buddy and D is waiting at the door
D: Did you change your mind?

I don't even know if we can have kids anymore we haven't had unprotected sex since our youngest.  I know the risks but damn........I want another kid, my wife seems adamant on a no so I don't think there really is a compromise to this.  

I was thinking about maybe we adopt a kid but I haven't told her yet that I've been thinking about this cause I don't want her to get upset and think that I don't love my kids cause I want another one.

She graduates in December from her university, and wants to join the Peace Corps leaving January, and I asked her to wait a year. I'm in culinary school (which she encouraged me to pursue) and would be graduating next year. The final capstone project is extremely intense, and high stress. She knows I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a while, and it would be an extremely hard time for me to not have her here, especially trying to work full time, pay our rent, go to school, and take care of our dog by myself. I would be busy with work/school from 7am-11pm most days. I don't have family in the area.

We've had a lot of conversations about travelling together after graduation, and I admit I've been kind of a back and forth about what I want to do. She's wanted to join the Peace Corps since she was young, and especially the location that she has a chance to go to right now is a big deal for her. She feels like she needs to travel while she's still young and before she has to settle down for work, and our life together. I asked her to wait one year until after I've graduated and have more free time, and then she can either join the Peace Corps or we can travel together. Her profession doesn't lend itself to a one-year job while she waits, and she doesn't want to get some random job in the mean time.

Her family, my family, and myself have all tried to convince her that this isn't the best choice financially, since she has student debt, and 2 years of lost income from 22-24 is a big deal. We both feel like we've sacrificed for the other, and both feel like this time we need to do what's right for ourselves.

Background: I am 20M and white. But I grew up in China since my dad transferred there when I was a baby. So I consider myself ethnically white (obviously) but culturally mostly Chinese. 

Story: Last year, I enrolled in college in the USA. Being “from” the USA I thought it would be a good experience and the “western” world has always appealed to me since my parents both grew up in the States and have told me stories about it (plus Western culture is everywhere in China). 

I shared my Insta account with some friends I made at college and they became outraged because I have pictures of me and my friends from home celebrating my 18th birthday with a feast that included dog meat. 

For those who might not know, in many parts of China, dog is common to eat. This is obviously upsetting to some westerners but to me, a picture of my friends and me celebrating by feasting around a roast dog is no different than Americans roasting a pig or roasting turkey on thanksgiving.

However, my college friends said I’m the asshole because most cultures “look down” on eating dog and cat and other such animals. they said that if I want to fit in with Americans I need to delete any “insensitive” pictures and that a White person (even if raised in China) who eats dog will be viewed very negatively.

My oldest brother always tried to be close with her, but mom always brushed him off/used him for bail money. Same with my youngest brother. I have never held a conversation with my mother, and have only seen her briefly maybe 6 times my entire life. Mom had a serious history of drug abuse as well.

We found out that she is on life support and things look pretty bad. Since she cut contact with the entire family and had no designated POA it was left up to all interested parties to nominate someone to hold control over medical conditions (it's a weird state law). My sister wanted nothing to do with it, my older brother can't handle the stress right now and we all agreed that the youngest is, well, the youngest and we don't want that burden on him. That left me, the one child that she has never even hugged and that knows her the least. I offered up our uncle, but he wanted it to be me as well.

The rest of the family wants it to be one of us, as they feel that is most appropriate. I want the best for her medical care, but after speaking with her doctor and nurses she won't be coming out of this/is brain dead.

I feel like she keeps getting angry at me for not having a relationship with my father, even though I feel like there wasnt one there to begin with, because she, essentially, has lost her dad. I keep trying to tell her that me trying to have a relationship with my dad would be like a kid trying to have a relationship with their sperm donor but she wont let go of it. Every now and then it causes a big argument and tonight was another one. So please, Internet denizens , tell me: Am I the Asshole?

96286,96286,eutsnl,1580156706.0,WIBTA For not wanting to do favors for an elderly neighbor?,"Longtime lurker, first time poster here.

So in my complex, we have an elderly neighbor, she doesn't live right next to us but in another building across from us. She's in her mid 60's and for context purposes, used to babysit me in her apartment.

Obviously due to her age, she constantly asks my dad for favors. Things ranging from moving furniture, to giving rides for her, and even having to check on her in the middle of the night because of noise complaints from her upstairs neighbors (relevant later). To be fair, she has compensated my dad for his time and recently has asked her to stop paying him.

Now I don't know her too well, despite her babysitting me all those years ago. My dad is usually the one that keeps in contact with her and all I currently know about her is that she actually owns some of the property in our complex that she rents out to other tenants.

Recently my dad has been asking me to do favors for her when he can't due to his job schedule and I have obliged the first several times. Most of these favors include driving her, and while she does have a license she personally doesn't want to drive (for obvious reasons) and doesn't like to. For context, the car that she has owned for 25 years hasn't even clocked above 10,000 miles.

One example is me driving her to the SS office in order to show her how to drive there HERSELF since she forgot. I ended up getting scolded by my parents for accepting money, despite using my mom's car to drive her there, thus using up her gas.

Now to be fair, I don't mind doing these favors, but I do mind when it starts to inconvenience me. I currently work 4 days of the week, 2 days I'm at an internship from 9-5 (unpaid, and the other 2 days I work for some family members with their online business (paid hourly). Friday's are the only time I'm free. Because my dad recently had to travel out of state for work, he's asked me to drive her tomorrow. This is personally starting to irk me, because I know for a fact she knows plenty of people and family members yet she only ever asks my dad for help. I also don't like my dad communicating to her that I can just drop what I'm doing to help her since he usually tells her yes before I have a say in it.

One instance that is another WITBA for the future, is my dad wanting me to sleepover at her place for a week because she has noise complaints against her upstairs neighbors. For the record, when she has called my dad to come investigate, he hasn't heard a thing, thus can't back up her claims. This means lights out at 9, and she has no wifi in case you were curious.

EDIT: Not stay for the entire week but just overnight, however still a huge chunk of my time since I work on projects at night.

I have yet to reach out to her (my dad finally gave me her number) and am currently on my lunch break as I type this. Part of me feels conflicted, since helping elderly people is the thing to do, but I also don't want to have to always stop my plans to help her. I know that if I just flat out reject her, I'm going to get an earful from my parents.

But I'm curious if I am an even bigger asshole for being upset with how my wife is reacting to this situation.  I'm at the character limit, ask info. 

My first asshole move - I was put on a performance plan at work, and didnt tell my wife.

I didnt tell my wife because I didnt think I was going to get fired. I was getting good feedback on my progress throughout the plan, some notes were made about where I needed further improvement but the tone of conversations was ""good job, we're getting there"" and my boss and I were regularly discussing projects and events that I would support which would take place well past the end of the plan. In this plan, they can decide to fire you at any time, but the day I actually got fired was the designated end date of the plan.

I should have told my wife, hands down, even when I thought my job was safe. I knew I wasnt performing to the best of my abilities for a number of reasons, which I dont want to list because I'm afraid it will just sound like I'm making excuses. I thought I was doing ""enough"", but if I had been doing my best this would not have happened.

So I told my wife, and she was initially supportive, although obviously upset that I didnt tell her it was possible for me to lose my job. However, since about 20min past that first conversation (a couple days ago), the support has evaporated.

For example, today when she got home from work, I got the silent treatment in this fashion:

I said hello when she walked in, got nothing. I asked what she wanted for dinner, got nothing. I suggested picking up sandwiches from a place she had mentioned earlier in the week, got nothing, I suggested a few things we have here I could cook, nothing. 
I give up for about an hour, then I say ""so that sandwich shop closes in less than an hour, want me to-""

""Fine.""

""..ok, I'll run and get it?""

""I'm coming with you.""

I fully understand she has a right to be upset with me for not being upfront. But I feel like I need her support right now. I know I fucked this all up, and I need to make it right - but the fact is we could live off of her salary alone (roughly matches my previous salary), I'm getting paid 6 months of severance pay, and we have a healthy savings. We dont have kids, our only debt is a car we could pay off tomorrow without touching our emergency fund. Getting fired is still not good and I am an asshole for getting fired, even bigger asshole for not telling her I might get fired, but come on - I'm the one who got fired!

I got home yesterday at around 6:30 PM and found my roommate, who is a very good friend, had invited over. But there's more, she had brought her 2-3 year old boy who was pretty adorable. Now keep in mind that I am a parent myself of a 3 year old boy and a 5 year old boy, so I'm VERY protective of kids so I might be overthinking things, but I don't think I am.

When I got there they had the kid sitting in the family room watching childrens shows, but the tv was muted and she had her music blasting really loud instead. now this music was, in my opinion, music that a 2-3 year old boy shouldn't be listening to for at least 10-13 more years. As an example, when Korns ""yall wanna single"" came on, she goes omg I love this one and turns it up even louder, to the point where we can barely hear each other talk.

Now I want to point out that my friend was pretty drunk at this point so I don't think he even realized anything was going on with the child because I know he wouldn't have been ok with it either, having a 2 year old and a 3 year old himself.

Around 8 PM I went and hid in my room cause she annoyed me, and for the next 2 hours I would say about 90% of the time this little boy was crying, and she either ignored it or would scream at him to shut up. He then went quiet, and about half an hour later I heard them go up to his room. I went out to see what happened to the boy and I saw him curled up in a little ball on the floor next to the couch in just a diaper. The ceiling fan above him was on and he was freezing to the touch, so I put a blanket over him but otherwise didn't want to move him.

I went over and I'm doing the dishes for about 10 minutes when I hear him wake up and start crying. I sat there for about 30 seconds to see if she was going to come down and take care of him, but when she didn't I went over to him and told him everything was gonna be ok and put my arms out to see if he'd let me pick him up, and he basically ran right into my arms. I rocked the little guy to sleep and held him for probably 5-10 minutes because I had a sneaking suspicion that he doesn't get much physical parental cuddles from mommy and all kids need that. I then laid him on the couch and put the blanket back over him.

Not 30 seconds later she gets on the intercom that ONLY announces to the speaker inside the lavatory. At about plane-engine volume I hear 'Please get out of the lavatory immediately a first class passenger needs to use it'.

The problem is that my mom would be quite destitute if I do so since she relies on my income at the moment.

&#x200B;

Im using a new account for this one because I can't remember the login credentials and didn't feel like going through the process of making a new one.

&#x200B;

Last week, at a happy hour company outing, I spoke with another co worker of mine about wanting to move out of my moms place and he mentioned how he was trying to do the same. He seems really cool and even gave a relatively reasonable time frame of a few months. I asked specifically if 3 months was alright instead and he said that it was absolutely fine. This got me really revved up about finally moving out. I've been staying back because my mom would not be able to support herself on her own. However, I don't think I want to pass up this opportunity.

&#x200B;

I don't like living with my mom. I find her to be controlling and manipulative based on the things she's said to me in the past. I am usually afraid to say whats on my mind when it comes to money because I feel like what I say will be taken the wrong way and that I'm accusing her of not trying hard enough. To some degree, I think that may be true. I have offered to pay for her to take the esthetician test to get her license, but she has never followed up or studied for it. Therapists in the past have mentioned that my mom is the prime reason for my stress.

&#x200B;

Whenever I say something back, she usually is accusatory and calls me names or says I treat her poorly because I don't respond back with much emotion, essentially. This is due with the suggestion that she may be a narcissist, so I adopted a method of dealing with her called ""grey walling"" or being a ""grey rock."" Which is essentially just keeping dialogue to a bare minimum and not opening conversation. ""how are you?"" ""fine, thanks"" and then finishing the conversation. I don't believe this has worked because she can talk 45 minutes about her distress and hark back to years when she wants to use my dad as an example of how I'm shitty because I'm like my dad.

&#x200B;

I've given her essentially $10,000 since I started my job last year to catch up on rent. And now she wanted me to help with the credit card debt, of which is mostly mine to help in the past few years to help us keep the apartment. I don't really want to give her more money but she's going to ask for more for furniture and for the credit card debt in the upcoming 6 months if I stay.

41869,41869,c6sl2v,1561771087.0,WIBTA if I create a GoFundMe for my birthday party?,"I'm from LA and I want to rent a mansion with a pool in the Hollywood Hills for my birthday. This is mostly so I can have a place large enough to host everybody (probably 50+ people), as well as having a place for people to sleep who are coming in from out of town (Or just to black out if they don't want to go home).

I'm planning on paying for everything myself. The mansion, keg, food, etc. I expect it will be $1,500 to $2,000. This is a lot of money for me. 

Every year I tell everyone not to buy me any gifts. I don't care about that kind of thing. (My birthday is usually pretty low key). 

I was thinking that when I send the invites, I would have a link to a GoFundMe. I would remind people that I don't need a present, but if they're so inclined, they could pitch in on the Airbnb. I would even include a note saying you can contribute anonymously or whatever, and that it's totally optional. 

I would set the goal at maybe $500 or something. I don't expect people to pitch in enough to cover everything. Maybe like $10 - $20 each person who contributes, with many not doing so. 

I think it's low pressure and realistic, but my friend said it's douchey, and that this kind of thing has negative connotations. 

So, WIBTA?



1) I can afford it. I don't need a GoFundMe to cover the cost of it. 

2) The reason I can afford it is because I have been saving for this part for about 10 months. That's why I said that this is a lot of money for me. 

3) Someone suggested that since I can afford it I should donate the money to charity. I have one charity I donate to on a monthly basis. If people contributed $500, that is several months of savings for this party that could be offset, which would be really useful to me, as I'm sure it would be to many of you. I'm not rich. I'm not making 6 figures or anything. I saved for a thing so I could have all my friends and family in one place.



That said, I would like to expand a bit:

This party isn't about ""celebrating ME"", as some of you have assumed. 

I'm getting older. I'm feeling nostalgic. I had a childhood friend die this year. Time is feeling more and more finite. There are people who I love, who I talk to and text every day, that I haven't seen on years. As time goes by, more and more people leave LA and scatter to the winds. 

This party is about bringing people together. People who I haven't seen in years, and people who haven't seen each other in years. 

People have expressed to me an interest in visiting me for my birthday, but LA is expensive and my apartment is small. I can't accommodate everyone who wants to visit. Hence, renting the huge house so everyone can stay. 

I have been saving for ten months, fully intending to pay for this all myself. These people have expressed concern about the cost of a hotel if they came to visit. If I rent this mansion, I will be saving about ten people hundreds of dollars, each, in hotel costs. 

Even if they pitch in $20 that they would have otherwise spent on a gift for me, despite me telling them not to (they always do), they would save HUNDREDS on hotels. 

THAT is why I'm booking a mansion. Not prestige.

Only yesterday did the idea pop into my head to do a GoFundMe. Before that, I spent ten full months saving thousands of dollars to bring friends together who haven't seen each other for years, using my birthday as an excuse for the occasion. I did this fully intending to pay everything by myself. 

But, because I dared to let the idea of spreading the cost of this out cross my mind, it seems I am an irredeemable asshole - to some of you, at least. 

Enough of the YTA camp have politely pointed out that it would be poor form, that I think I agree with them. I don't think I'll do a GoFundMe at this point.

94705,94705,es0iog,1579638579.0,AITA for Not Keeping In Touch,"First I want to give a little background:

From 2017 to the beginning of 2019 I was dealing with cancer & going through a lot of treatments that made me feel awful. During the first year and a half of treatment I tried to live my life as normally as I could by hanging out with friends, going out, working, etc. By 2018 my condition worsened and I needed to be hospitalized for a bone marrow transplant. The procedure had complications and I was hospitalized for longer than originally planned. 

During that year of treatment I didn't text or call my friends much because I spent a lot of time excruciatingly sick, in & out of black out like sleep, or too weak to get out of bed. By this time I had stopped leaving the house for long periods of time and was on extended disability & med leave from work.

That whole year my friends never called me, never visited me at the hospital, or make any type of communication to me. We have a group chat with all of us in it (5 people), despite feeling sick and not physically up to hanging out, I did send out a couple of text periodically seeing how they were doing and apologizing for not being able to hang out. Most of my texts went unanswered, so I eventually stopped altogether. No one even came to visit me in the hospital. My mother & wife came to see me daily, but my friends never showed up.

So now 2019 happens and I'm beginning to feel better. I eventually have my friends over once every so often. Things have changed. The first time I see them after a year we went out for a simple dinner. They spent the whole time talking around me about subjects I either knew nothing about (new anime they were watching as a group) or subjects I didn't care about (like Magic the Gathering). It was like I wasn't even there. I tried steering the conversation into neutral ground, something we could all weigh in on, but after a few half-assed replies the conversations would go back to not including me.

My oldest friend, we have been friends for almost 25 years, later apologized to me saying he was being a bad friend and I said I was being one too. And that was that.

I last saw them in Oct last year. Once November hit, I went into a deep depression because my latest check up was coming. It was an important check up as I was diagnosed with cancer December 2016, then after being in remission for a month & a half the cancer came back more aggressive in December 2017. Now After battling cancer during all of 2018, this new Dec. 2019 check up brought me depression & anxiety. Luckily I am still in remission, so after the holidays my depression began to lighten.

Now I don't know what to do. I'm angry because I feel like my friends don't talk to me or want to hang out unless I specifically start the conversation, but I also feel guilty because I think I've been a pretty bad friend.

I'm mad at them and I feel guilty all at the same time.

I’m a senior in college and have lived in a house for 3 yrs. Last year, I started a relationship. We eventually decided to live together. I was already on the lease of the house, and since the previous roommate was moving out, my ex (then, girlfriend) wanted to move in. I was hesitant to live with an SO, but accepted. Pretty soon, we broke up in May, but had resigned the lease in April already. So this year, I’m living with my ex. There’s also 2 other roommates. The 2 roommates and I get along, but there’s obvious avoidance between the ex and I. I have conversation with the other two, but I only communicate politely about cleaning, bills etc with the ex if possible. 

When I moved back I made sure to set my boundaries clearly so that ex wouldn’t try and get me back. I made it clear that I planned to have a dating life, and didn’t care if she did the same. As long as I can’t hear her having sex with people, and she can’t hear me, I’m fine. She agreed, we move on. 

Fast forward a month. She has decided to fuck one of my “friends” who lives with my other friend, so I had to leave a friend group due to her always being at that house. It sucks, but I have other friends. She can do what she wants, so I don’t confront her. 

I found a great date on tinder, and we decided to bake at my house for a first date. Funny enough, she just ended a relationship and is in the same position as me. But since her relationship just ended, she doesnt want to have guests yet. I plan the date for my house when ex is working until 10:30. 

Date goes well. We bake downstairs while other roommates mill about. After that, we have sex while no one else is home. While we’re laying up after, I get a text that I don’t read. 10 minute later, I get a call from ex, which I silence, since I’m headed downstairs anyway and can talkl in person. 

2 minutes later, I go to walk date out of the front door, & hear ex sniffling and holler for me from the back door. She says she’s been avoiding coming home because roommate told her that I was on a date. She assumed that we were hanging out downstairs, and the thought of seeing me with someone else was enough to make her cry. Thing is, I’d been upstairs for the last hour, and had been done having sex for 20 minutes before anyone was home. The only contact she had with the date was hearing her voice as she’s walking out he front door and ex was coming in.  I apologize for missing her call but that’s it. 

She now says she can’t live with this, and needs to move out (good), but until then, she wants me to text her every time I have a romantic guest downstairs. She’s the only bedroom downstairs by the kitchen and living room. 

It seems unreasonable to me. I would still plan to have dates over mostly when she’s not around anyway. I feel like since I pay rent, I have every right to use the kitchen and living room as I please (within reason).

My husband came to Canada from a country in Africa to compete (semi) professionally in decathlons. We met and got married shortly afterwards. Due to the laws in Canada, he couldn't work until he got his work permit which took about a year. So he's working as a personal trainer like max 9 hours a week and he trains for his decathlons about 3+ hours every night. I work full time and go to school full time during the school year. 

I didn't mind supporting him when he couldn't work. But now that he can work, I'm getting a bit crabby. Yes he has a job. But he's dragging his heels (by my perspective) in finding a second job because a lot of jobs will interfere with him training for decathlons. I'm getting very resentful of his hobby as it's costing me money and he won't even consider cutting back on the training to work more. I've sacrificed a lot to support us, including my own hobbies. We have the opportunity to get out of a horrible living situation but I'm nervous because I would realistically be the only one supporting us. Still.

Idk if it's fair of me to ask him to cut back somewhat. He is very good at doing decathlons, and has many opportunities to compete internationally. Not for money tho. I'm terrified of him resenting me. This is his dream and he is one of the few men who I know who is brave enough to follow his dream enough to move continents.

My cousin(21F) somehow knew about this and out of nowhere assumed that we are the best of best friends. You see, despite being a norm, she adores the LGBT community, with her social media full of related quotes, arguments, research links and pictures of herself with a bunch of people whom you cannot call ""him"" or ""her"" carelessly. 

She insisted that I, too, belongs to the LGBT community(which I couldn't care less) and tried to introduce me to her LGBT friends. I have nothing against LGBT(more like simply not interested), but I do not like making friends with complete strangers, especially since my cousin herself had made me warned me to be careful how I speak with them. 

It gets quite frustrating over time, it's like she just keep buzzing around me and tell me about everything she knows about asexual people(I only know myself, why should I be bothered with other asexual people), about her amazing transgender or gay friends(again, nothing to do with me) and about how I should ""come out""(come out where? Must I announce it everywhere I go? Coz that sounds really silly). I have been either ignoring her or decling as politely as I could. 

Then there came a day I was went to an Anime convention, met a male cosplay that did a really good job of my favorite character(see username), so I asked to take a picture with him and after some chat, added him as a friend. Later that day I posted the picture on my social media, tagging him.

My dear cousin left a comment ""You did tell him that you are asexual right?"". And ofcourse, since I tagged the cosplay guy I assume he saw that comment too. I am pretty certain I added him as a normal friend, and he knew that too. That does not mean, however, that I have the need to tell him I am asexual.

I replied to her comment ""I have seen freaks, dicks and pricks, and you are identified as all three.""

She is now trying to shame me and tell everybody that I am transphobic and homophobic, great. I don't regret roasting her like that though, AITA?",False,not the asshole,5,8.0,0,"AITA For Roasting My Cousin Online I am asexual(25F) and while it is not a secret, I don't go around telling people that.

My cousin(21F) somehow knew about this and out of nowhere assumed that we are the best of best friends. You see, despite being a norm, she adores the LGBT community, with her social media full of related quotes, arguments, research links and pictures of herself with a bunch of people whom you cannot call ""him"" or ""her"" carelessly. 

She insisted that I, too, belongs to the LGBT community(which I couldn't care less) and tried to introduce me to her LGBT friends. I have nothing against LGBT(more like simply not interested), but I do not like making friends with complete strangers, especially since my cousin herself had made me warned me to be careful how I speak with them. 

It gets quite frustrating over time, it's like she just keep buzzing around me and tell me about everything she knows about asexual people(I only know myself, why should I be bothered with other asexual people), about her amazing transgender or gay friends(again, nothing to do with me) and about how I should ""come out""(come out where? Must I announce it everywhere I go? Coz that sounds really silly). I have been either ignoring her or decling as politely as I could. 

Then there came a day I was went to an Anime convention, met a male cosplay that did a really good job of my favorite character(see username), so I asked to take a picture with him and after some chat, added him as a friend. Later that day I posted the picture on my social media, tagging him.

My dear cousin left a comment ""You did tell him that you are asexual right?"". And ofcourse, since I tagged the cosplay guy I assume he saw that comment too. I am pretty certain I added him as a normal friend, and he knew that too. That does not mean, however, that I have the need to tell him I am asexual.
