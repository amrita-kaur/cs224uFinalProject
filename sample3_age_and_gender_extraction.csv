So my mum has no sense of boundaries. She's one of those people who's like 'what's mine is yours' and I'm all for sharing but this is getting ridiculous. We're the same size in shoes and clothes so naturally sometimes take things from each other's wardrobe, but not often. But she's taking it too far. I can't have makeup on my dressing table as it'll go missing, and when I find it in her bag she just says 'oh but we always share!' when it's been completely used and I've not had chance to even wear it. She does the same with food - if I buy something nice to eat for later, I'll come back to it and it'll have been eaten or put in the bin without me knowing. 

It's gotten to the point where I have to hide new purchases to stop her from taking them. If I buy a new top or an expensive perfume, it goes missing! I recently bought a gorgeous new pair of shoes for my birthday, and she's already told me two events she wants to wear them to. The final straw was the Easter eggs, and it's pretty petty tbh.

So at Easter we had a few Easter eggs, and we've both been eating them. My boyfriend got me one, and my boyfriends parents bought me a big Easter egg which I was trying to savour as it had some lovely extra chocolates. She ate it. She ate it and didn't tell me, and I'm pissed off ngl. She could have had any one of the other eggs but no, she had to have the one which was a gift. I have to lie to my boyfriend and tell him how good the chocolate was and how I really enjoyed it, when I haven't had it. I kinda feel like enough is enough, it's petty I know, but I'm sick of having to 'share' my belongings when if I take something of hers I get yelled at or told I'm not allowed. She's not my sister, she's my mother, why can't she just have her own things and let me have mine?

I feel like an asshole for having to hide my purchases from her but it's the only way I get to enjoy them.

Just some backstory to try prove I'm not a 'danger', like a sexual stalker or anything lol.

So anyway, yesterday I went to McDonalds with my dad, and I saw a guy working there and in my head was like ""holy crap hello future husband"". I find Asian guys really attractive and he was Asian, I think Chinese (his name on his nametag looked Chinese, I'm more into Japanese guys, but Chinese is fine with me!) and had a really nice voice, nice stubbly moustache and really good looking hands.

A week ago I had a dream about going to a Katy Perry concert and touched her hand and I felt happy about that, and the night before last night I had a dream Gerard Way was doing a private concert in a zoo enclosure and I touched his hand multiple times and it felt euphoric! So I've had a bit of a thing with hands recently.

Anywho, we go up and order, some other guy does our order and I'm secretly disappointed. After our meal I say I'm gonna go order another drink, in my hopes of seeing sexy Asian guy again- and I did! He even took my order! I also made sure when I handed him my money to 'accidentally' brush my finger on his hand, and it was so exciting, it gave me butterflies!

I took mental note of his name, and on the way home found him on Facebook. He was the first person who popped up after writing his name, so it's not like I was 'hunting' for him. I didn't want to forget what he looked like so I saved his profile picture (only picture I could get of him without friending him).

Today my friend came over and was on my phone and saw the picture. She asked me who the guy was and I told her the story and she said that I was really creepy and should delete the photo. At first I said no and she started to get pissed off, so then I did. But when she left I just redownloaded the photo again.

I don't understand though, I'm not harming him by having the photo, he doesn't even know i have it. And I'm not really into sex so it's not like I'm going to try anything with him, the photo's just a bit of eye candy.

72066,72066,dmrd59,1571972782.0,AITA for telling my dad to stop with the weird jokes?,"TL;DR at bottom

My dad (m46) has this new girlfriend ""Jen"" (f46). My family's sort of a mess but it's important to understand. I'm (f19) the eldest, followed by ""Sean"" (m17), ""Julie"" (f16), and ""Mary"" (f14). Note Sean, Julie, and I are from my dad's first marriage and Mary is from a second marriage. Jen and Dad moved in together a few months ago and it's all been okay. Jen has three sons, ""John"" (m27), ""Eric"" (m24), and ""Micah"" (m6). Micah's dad (m42) still comes around when dropping him off and such. 

Sometimes Dad and Jen will make comments about ""how beautiful"" Julie and Mary are and will talk about how cute they would be with Jen's kids. She talks about them marrying and having kids with her son's. Jen especially teases Julie and Mary about how they must be so enamoured by her handsome and strong sons (John and Eric). Julie and Mary for the most part awkwardly brush it aside but the teasing would not stop. Most of it was started by Jen but then my dad would start up with it too. The jokes about Mary and Julie just wouldn't stop though and eventually Mary, Julie, and I asked my dad (and in extension Jen) to stop.

My dad was furious when we asked. He was saying how it's unfair that were ganging up on Jen like that and how ""she was just trying to compliment you girls!"" We still asserted it was not appropriate and Mary and Julie didn't feel comfortable hearing these jokes. After an hour of yelling back and fourth dad was like ""fine, whatever"" and I thought it was the end of that until Mary piped up and was like ""jeeze, dad, thanks. It was weird because it was like incest"" which then led to my dad screaming at her for using ""that word"" and saying that she ""better not let anyone else hear her say that word in any context dealing with Jen or else I'll have to leave her, especially if word gets back to your (Mary's) mother!"" We were all sorta stunned into an awkward silence then left our own ways.

Later in the car with just my dad and Sean I asked my dad why he got so upset when talking about the conversation and he started complaining about how ""we should be making Jen feel more like a part of the family"" - we do - ""and we shouldn't be so sensitive."" I stood my ground and said that they had every right to be upset about those jokes. Dad then got all weird with the incest word again and I asked why. Apparently Jen's husband committed a sex crime which Mary's mother knows about and if word of another sex crime is even mentioned around Mary then Dad will have to break it off with Jen so charges aren't filed considering Jen's husband still comes around... Conversation dropped after that but to this day my dad still talks about how annoyingly sensitive we are and how we shouldn't get so ""triggered.""

I'm 24F. My parents married at 18, and had 3 more daughters, now 21, 19 and 16. Mum walked out when I was 10, and died of an overdose midway through divorce proceedings, which means Dad was a 28-year-old widower single father of 4 daughters. He worked every hour and every shift he could to give us all a decent childhood, which he did, and still found time to be both Mother and Father to us, with occasional help from our grandmother and her sisters.

Because he worked so much and assumed responsibility at a young age, and because Mum was his ""childhood sweetheart"", Dad isn't very experienced at romantic relationships. And because only my youngest sister lives at home now, he's found more time to get out and start enjoying himself.

2 months ago Dad met Jackie (name changed) through work, and she's already moved in with him and my sister in Dad's house. I've found her very pushy and overbearing, like she's trying to be my mother. I've asked my sister what Jackie is like to live with and she says that she's like a dictator, ordering Dad around the house, telling him to do the housework and make her drinks or prepare her food, as she sits and watches TV all evening (they work the same hours, so there's nothing to stop her pitching in). My sister also says that Jackie hogs the bathroom and generally acts like she owns the house. My other sisters don't like her much either, and feel the same way as I do: that Jackie is A) uncomfortable to be around and B) using Dad.

We've all tried telling Dad this but he won't hear it, telling us that Jackie doesn't mean to be rude, or that we don't really know her yet and to give her a chance, or something similar. We put it down to him being inexperienced in relationships and probably in ""love"" with her, but it hurts us because he can't see how she's treating him and he won't listen to our view on the situation.

Hide the tank in her room and hope my parents never walk in and see it (they would)

And hide the frozen mice in the bottom of our freezer. (We have a huge chest freezer that is full of meat. This wouldn't work because my parents dig around in it daily.)

In previous years, my company has provided donations and done paid work for her charity. After we split, I referred them elsewhere, since I didn't want to work with her (very bad breakup). This week, the competitor I referred them to called me and said he couldn't fill an order the charity needed for a big and important event.

I(20f) have lived together with a friend(19m) for 3 months, and it has become clear that we're not a good fit for being roommates. I have Asperger’s syndrome (he’s aware of this), which makes me require a “high” degree of cleanliness and little noise. This has only become a big issue for me after we've moved in together. 

We agreed that it would be best if I moved out, and we set the moving date far out, so that he could find a new roommate without having to pay double rent. Meanwhile, due to noise and general feeling of untidiness (I’m probably an AH here, but I have trouble dealing with other people’s messes and seeing it stresses me out), I have been feeling my mental health worsen. I have tried to make sure that he didn’t feel like he had to walk on eggshells around the house, as I know that not everyone has the same cleanliness standards, and I've also tried my best to not be harsh on him or expect more than the usual.

Now the problem is, yesterday he told me that he's been lying about upholding some of my cleanliness standards (washing cleaning cloths used to clean the toilet, meaning touched literal shit stains, at 90 degrees Celsius or at least keeping them separate from counter wiping cloths and dishrags when washing them) ever since we've moved in together. He says it’s only been a couple of times, as he forgets to wash them at that temperature since he’s used to doing it differently. I’m not angry at him for forgetting, that’s what happens. But I’m mad at the reason he lied. According to him, I have a very scary face, especially when I’m disappointed. This made him not want to tell me as to not “hurt me or disappoint me”.

The fact that he's been lying to me, along with my mental health, made me move the move-out date to as soon as possible. I did this today and I told my roommate this evening. He got very sad and frustrated at this, saying that he had feared I would ""go off and do something impulsive"" if he told me.

Prior to us dating she had been away on a semester abroad together with her best friend and subsequently they went travelling together after (8 months away total). However before she went away we had been exclusive for about 3 months but decided we weren't going to do long distance but stayed in close contact during this time and maintaining a good relationship. Furthermore we had agreed to effectively hide social media evidence from each other of us seeing other people to protect each other's feelings (my idea). Lastly its worth mentioning I never really felt that uncomfortable learning or hearing about my girlfriend's exes before we met, but hearing about stuff she did while she was away does get under my skin.

Following her and her best friend's time away we got back together straight away. However at every possible opportunity her best friend will tell everyone about all the sexually explicit details of every encounter my girlfriend had while she was away (both when its just us 3 up to groups of 15 of our friends). Now I was never under the impression that she wouldn't be seeing other guys and nor am I going to pretend I didn't see anyone either. However, I made it very clear to my girlfriend that I had no interest in knowing about what she got up to while she was away because I  find it upsetting. I have made it clear to on a number of times to my girlfriend's best friend I find hearing about that sort of stuff upsetting both when alone with her, but particularly in front of all our friends friends.

So about a month ago my girlfriend's best friend introduced her new bf to our social group. He is a nice enough guy who I don't have anything against. Now my girlfriend's best friend has a pretty extensive and colourful sexual history. Initially, it was never my intention to bring up some of these stories in front of her new boyfriend but as per usual we are all hanging out and she starts talking about 5 minutes worth of stories about my girlfriend I'd rather not hear. So I snapped. I replied along the lines of ""ahah yea, that's kinda of like the time you..."" and proceeded to make some pretty graphic references. Sure enough she pretty taken back by that and while the group laughed it off at the time. I get told by my girlfriend the next day that was totally not cool and her best friend is very upset with me. Ultimately, while I feel so petty, I have to say it felt great to finally give her a taste of her own medicine.

UPDATE: Points to commonly asked questions

1. GF gets upset with best friend for doing this but only seems to spur her on.
2. I think best friend likes me but not sure (is generally chatty and friendly outside of interactions described above).
3. Not implausible gf's best friend is keen on her. One story is they had a threesome with a guy. Also maybe relevant I had one night stand with best friend before dating gf (which she said she had no problem with/knew before we started dating)
4. Outcome 48 hours on, GF angry at me for potentially ruining friends relationship (never had long term boyfriend before) but ultimately on my side. Best friend still very upset at me and says I was serious when she was only ever joking and her comments never affected my relationship (not true).
5.

Definitely not as dramatic as most of the other posts here but for context, my girlfriend and I have been going out for over a year. Prior to us dating she had been away on a semester abroad together with her best friend and subsequently they went travelling together after (8 months away total). However before she went away we had been exclusive for about 3 months but decided we weren't going to do long distance but stayed in close contact during this time and maintaining a good relationship. Furthermore we had agreed to effectively hide social media evidence from each other of us seeing other people to protect each other's feelings (my idea). Lastly its worth mentioning I never really felt that uncomfortable learning or hearing about my girlfriend's exes before we met, but hearing about stuff she did while she was away does get under my skin.

Following her and her best friend's time away we got back together straight away. However at every possible opportunity her best friend will tell everyone about all the sexually explicit details of every encounter my girlfriend had while she was away (both when its just us 3 up to groups of 15 of our friends). Now I was never under the impression that she wouldn't be seeing other guys and nor am I going to pretend I didn't see anyone either. However, I made it very clear to my girlfriend that I had no interest in knowing about what she got up to while she was away because I  find it upsetting. I have made it clear to on a number of times to my girlfriend's best friend I find hearing about that sort of stuff upsetting both when alone with her, but particularly in front of all our friends friends.

So about a month ago my girlfriend's best friend introduced her new bf to our social group. He is a nice enough guy who I don't have anything against. Now my girlfriend's best friend has a pretty extensive and colourful sexual history.

84757,84757,ebsw6w,1576569325.0,AITA for making my colleagues job more tedious for him for revenge?,"8 years ago I (30m) started in a small business (gov related) as the only IT person. There was a planned job for an external IT sysadmin and I was offered to take that job too and I gladly did (as I was already doing all the work, now with almost double pay). So I was the internal IT Helpdesk and the external Contractor.

4 years later I got a colleague (40m) because our IT has grown and management put him with me to help me out as I was pretty much at capacity. I basically was his superior and gave him things to do with the servers and PC repairs and such.

Over the last years I have been expanding my IT skills and grown my business, had multiple customers so I decided to step back as IT Helpdesk person and just be the Contractor for this job. My colleague didn't get my job because of his qualifications, I was replaced by a new colleague but they only took the IT Helpdesk part.

Now here is where the ""fun"" starts.

Turns out my original colleague never liked me and only after a few months of me not being his boss anymore he convinced management that **I'm no longer needed** as the external Contractor as he can will do it without a raise so basically take over my job but without pay. Management informed me that they will no longer need my services because they're not going to forbid him to do more work for the same salary.

I really felt betrayed so I started reading all contracts and regulations (gov related job, everything public) and found out that this colleague isn't allowed by law to do what I did because of his lack of qualifications and I informed the employer about that and now he can't touch servers (which he loved) and is basically reduced to cleaning devices and doing level 1 support (which he hates).

24344,24344,bb28s8,1554775030.0,AITA for telling my (32m) girlfriend (33f) I do more than half?,"My girlfriend (let’s call her Martha) and I live together. She’s dealing with mental health issues and is right now unable to work. She’s not on disability though, and therefore doesn’t have an income. I work 5 days a week, sometimes 6, because I cover all the expenses.

Rent, groceries, going out/ordering in, pharmacy/apartment stuff, and a hundred dollars a week for her therapy are roughly my expenses for the month. It’s really tough and I live paycheck to paycheck.

Martha does all the housework. Laundry, cleaning the bathroom, dusting, majority of dishes, keeping the apartment tidy, etc.  I’d say about once or twice a month I do the dishes, once a week I take out the garbage, and very rarely I cook. She generally makes dinner in our one bedroom apartment.

So lately, Martha’s been insisting that I acknowledge she “puts in half” in our relationship. At first I just agreed, but lately it’s really been bothering me and when she brought it up again today, I finally said something about it. It was something like,

“I think you put in the same amount of *effort* as I do, but I am contributing more right now- but that is OK. Your mental health isn’t in order and I understand you need time to get better, but I really need you to appreciate what I’m doing for this relationship, what I’m sacrificing, and how much I work.”

Martha *really* did not like my thinking this way. She said I’m selfish for thinking that, and arrogant, and that what she does at home is unappreciated. I told her that isn’t the case- if I had the choice, she would have a job and we would both do half the housework. I want her to understand that the current situation sucks for me and I’m working overtime to contribute.

I can’t afford stuff right now like an engagement ring, vacation, or taking time off (I don’t get any paid leave or sick days). Sometimes Martha will ask where her ring is, and it’s really making me feel like she doesn’t appreciate me or doesn’t understand. If I tell her I have zero money, she’ll say I don’t make enough at my job.

I told her tonight that while I appreciate what she does here at home, I’m still working overtime and putting in more *right now*, in order for her to get better.

Every time he says “babe, once this is sorted the car should be sweet for another good 6 months”, something goes or he finds something  wrong with the car and rather than planning for repairing it, we will discuss to move bills around so we can accomodate the car. Last fortnight I got a bonus from my work and I told myself I’m gonna treat myself cause I hadn’t treated myself in a while. So I got myself an Apple TV and make up and skin care value of $300+ 

Fast forward. 

Earlier this week, my grandma from overseas calls me to tell me that my great grandma (my mums grandma- I am very close with her) that she may not make it till Friday. Her organs had begun to fail. I got stressed so I went to work and asked what do I do these situation and they gave me the 30th - 7th off. However, I had not even organised tickets or a time yet so here I am stressed already staring at the time. 2 days later, my great grandma passed away. 
I was devastated and being that her first grandchild has stepped away from the family, I needed to step up and show my respect as we live 7 hours away by plane. 
My partner and I we had the money saved up for his major service $1200 
The tickets were gonna cost $1350 for return to fly home. 
He told me he wouldn’t be able to get me home because that’s just life, we have bills babe. We can’t miss them. I know you’re upset but bro adult you’ve gotta miss things. I was upset and hurt I asked him if we can postpone his car service and he said we can’t. It will just shit itself and turn into your car. (My car has gotten us from A-B for much longer than his car and it never caused any issues). I asked him if I could use my friends money who offered and he blatantly said no. No discussion. I’m waiting for my dad to respond but he’s not being very easy to speak with as he’s also overseas.",24.0,F

For some context, I (22f) and my husband (24m) have been married for almost 4 years now, and together for 7. His cousin (25f) *was* my best friend in HS and is the whole reason we met.

This is where I probably should provide some backstory. Her parents were already older when they married and had her, so she grew up surrounded by hospitals and medical problems and never really had a childhood. She's an only child who was basically raised to care for her parents from the start, while battling many medical issues herself (she had scoliosis as a kid and it caused permanent nerve damage and she has rods in her back). Going to college was the only chance she ever had at an escape, and even that was ripped from her after her first year when her father was diagnosed with cancer. 

A few years later my husband and I found out that she and her father (her mother was in a nursing home at this point as her dimentia worsened and she stopped allowing help) were in a rough spot financially so we decided, since we were able, that we would take the opportunity to help out. A month later her father (my husband's uncle) passed away. 

Upon news of his passing, her landlord immediately evicted her from the only home she's known, leaving her only 30 days to gather all of her things by herself while her hoarding mother is screaming in her ear about every gadget and knick-knack she should save. My husband and I immediately took her in to our home as at this point we're her only living family and he feels responsible for her. 

This is where it gets tricky. As previously mentioned, she's older than both of us, yet has absolutely 0 actual life skills. In the past year and a half she has lived with us, we have become her parents, while she barely lifts a finger. We coerced her into getting her first ever real job working maybe 15~ hours a week (we don't need her money, we're just trying to do what we can to get her on her feet), made her get her driver's permit (that she ""loses"" every time we ask if she wants to drive so she demands we drive her), and cover absolutely all of her living expenses except for her phone. I do her laundry unwillingly as she mixes it in our basket, wash all of the dishes, and do generally every single bit of the household cleaning, minus changing her cat's litter box as I'm allergic to them (I have photo evidence of huge piles of poop just sitting and rotting on the carpet in ""her"" room). We also buy all of the groceries and do all of the cooking for 3 grown adults.

WIBTA if I asked her to leave? We've sat her down before and tried to talk about her helping out, and she started crying about how much her life sucks and generally acts like it's our responsibility to fix.

Ok so some backstory, I am living at a lot that my boyfriend's mom owns. She had a partnership with a longtime friend who passed last year, and with evidence of contracts from their llc she was able to prove that she was the rightful owner of the property, as it was under the llc name. The man's son is(was at the time) a prestigious lawyer, and decided he had claim over everything, and tried suing for it. He came onto this property and began taking everything he believed was his. Apparently the chief of police or whoever has high standing in the department in our small town is his cousin, and was helping him, but that's another story, I dont know all the details. From my understanding the lawyer has been fighting a losing battle, but the legal stuff is not over yet, so I have been warned by my boyfriends family that since he has been laying low since February, I should be fine but if anyone comes on the property to call them and they'll call their lawyer to rack up more evidence against him.

So I (21F) am naturally cautious when people come to my living quarters. It's in a remote area, in a dead end neighborhood. There's 'no trespassing' and 'private property' signs posted at the entrance. Today as I was leaving to go run some errands a four wheeler pulls into my yard. I go out to greet them and say 'can I help you?' This older woman and I guess either her friend or family member were sitting in it (both female). The driver said 'oh, I'm just showing her around!' I said 'ok?' And kinda glared at them. Then I guess to make it more ok she said 'I am *my boyfriends mom*'s friend. I just repeated 'ok?' And glared at them till they backed out.

 Immediately called my boyfriends dad since hes the one who usually comes up and does yardwork and was planning on coming later in the day. I told him ' I didnt mean to be an ass to them. If they had come and said 'hey we're neighbors just wanted to say hi' that's fine but just coming up to a strangers residence with a no trespassing and private property sign to 'show around' my place is definitely trespassing, unwelcome, and creepy. Especially to a 21 year old female who is alone'
He said hell talk to them and tell them not to do it again.

Sorry for the bad english and the possible grammar/spelling mistakes. I hope i can get your honest opinion on this issue since im not sure if i can judge things objectivly at the moment.

Me (m29) and my now ex girlfriend (f24) recently broke up, short time after an abortion. Even tho we were using contraception she got pregnant some 9 weeks ago. Whe8n initially telling me about this after a positive pregnancy test she said that shes going to abort it cause she just started to study. My reaction was to agree on the abortion but i also told her that i would take full responsability if she chose to keep it. Over the course of the following weeks it became clear to me that she had big troubles thinking about the abortion more and more, even telling me that an abortion would destroy her. The week before the abortion was due i told her again that its her body and her choice but that i would clearly prefer the abortion beceause i couldnt see myself with a kid in the current situation. I never said that i want to keep it tho. Im sure that my opinion was a big part why she aborted, but i feel like ive never pressured her to do it activly.

This is the first part where i feel like an asshole cause i feel like my stance on the issue made her go for the decision she took. And it really really is hurting her now. She told me that she hates me for speaking so clearly and without doubt for the abortion, wich is true. I had a clear stance and was prefering the abortion throughout the whole process eventho i said that i would take responsability if she chooses to keep it and that its her choice in the end.

Some days after the abortion she broke up with me for differnt reasons including my stance on the abortion. But things were not going to well before that. After she broke up she asked me if i would want the relationship if i could choose. I just shoock my head. Now she is mad at me, saying i didnt even fight for the relationship, somehow making me feel / making it look like i broke up with her.

I feel responsible to be there for her now cause the abortion is hurting her so much cause i feel like she did it for me.

6495,6495,9zwgb4,1543043083.0,AITA for rejecting a guy by telling him that I'm gay?,"Last week my friend (16 M) had invited me (16 F) to go out with friends. In the past, he has asked me out about three times, and I declined all three times due to timing. I agreed to go because I believed that he was no longer interested in me. We have also known each other since about elementary school.

The day before we meet up, he tells me that his friends had plans come up that day and could no longer go. I still agreed to go, since I didn't have plans that day anyway.

Once I get to the restaurant we agreed to meet up at, he offers to pay for my food. I insist that I pay for my own food, but he pays anyway.  We then sit down, eat, and catch up on what has been going on in our lives. The conversation is relaxed as usual, however, I started to question what his intentions were after he paid for my food. After we finish eating, I suggest that we go to his house because we had been talking about playing games with his family.

At his house, we play games and continue to talk. He and I were sitting next to each other relatively close because his room was quite small. He suddenly asks me if he can put his arm around me. At first, I was relieved that he asked, but then I started to panic. I didn't know what to do, so I irrationally blurt out, ""Actually, I'm gay. Sorry!"" 

He is obviously confused, and I tell him that I didn't want to tell anyone as I didn't feel ready yet. He was completely understanding. I then tell his brother, whom I am close to as well, that I am gay. They both tell me that I have no reason to apologize for my sexuality. I thank them, and we all continue on with our day.

I want to further explain why saying ""I'm gay"" was the first thing that came to my mind. I really didn't want to reject him because in my experience, after rejection, I start to blame myself for not being good enough for that person. This guy is extremely kind and there is no specific reason why I didn't have interest in him. I just really didn't want him to pick himself apart because he thought he wasn't good enough; he is perfectly fine the way he is. If he found out the reason he was rejected was out of his control, he wouldn't feel bad.

Of course, it was not okay of me to lie about serious matters such as sexuality, but it happened quickly, and I felt pressured at that moment. My intentions were not to hurt him, since he's an incredibly good friend of mine. 

Am I the asshole for rejecting him by saying that I'm gay because I don't want him to beat himself up over it?

I then tell his brother, whom I am close to as well, that I am gay. They both tell me that I have no reason to apologize for my sexuality. I thank them, and we all continue on with our day.

I want to further explain why saying ""I'm gay"" was the first thing that came to my mind. I really didn't want to reject him because in my experience, after rejection, I start to blame myself for not being good enough for that person. This guy is extremely kind and there is no specific reason why I didn't have interest in him. I just really didn't want him to pick himself apart because he thought he wasn't good enough; he is perfectly fine the way he is. If he found out the reason he was rejected was out of his control, he wouldn't feel bad.

Of course, it was not okay of me to lie about serious matters such as sexuality, but it happened quickly, and I felt pressured at that moment. My intentions were not to hurt him, since he's an incredibly good friend of mine. 

Am I the asshole for rejecting him by saying that I'm gay because I don't want him to beat himself up over it?

11313,11313,ajcopt,1548338471.0,AITA for getting annoyed at my mum for not trying to learn the language of the country she has lived in for 20 years?,"Moving this further up because people seem to disregard the edits: her English skills are adequate, she knows enough to get by but struggles from time to time. 

So I (19F) just got into an argument with my mum (47), and long story short it all started from when I made a comment about how her and my father can barely speak English, despite having lived here for 20 years. 

What started off as something I said in passing blew up into something which led to an explosive argument and lead to me storming off to my room. You see here’s the thing, she was complaining about how it’s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.

Here’s what she said, that there’s no need to ‘waste’ her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn’t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn’t have time to invest in learning the language. 

Right. Okay. That doesn’t make any sense. 

She then said she doesn’t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she’s an old woman.

I then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. 

Suddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are ‘invalid’ and I need to fix up? 

I just walked out, my last words being,  ‘you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.’ 

AITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? 

I’m not crazy right? 

Edit: Just for clarification, she doesn’t have much family here, most of them scattered to different parts of the world after the war. She’s been through hell and back and most of her direct family were slaughtered by a terrorist group in front of her, she fled to Italy and later moved to England after she met my dad and had me. That’s just a bit of background info if it helps with anything. 

Edit #2: She knows enough to get by, she just struggles a bit. Tried to enrol to college, stayed there for a year, had another child and she works full time whilst supporting 5 kids. Father doesn’t really help out, the way I may have said it makes it sound likes she knows jack shit, but that’s not the case. 

What I’m trying to say is she’s lost hope and instead she tries her best to pay for our tuition and books and stuff, for us to have a better future than her. But it still annoys me because I want her to live a good life too. 

Edit #3: wow it actually kind of hurts to see my mum being spoken about such a way in the comments. I feel the need to defend her.

She speaks English to an acceptable degree, can read and write but if you were to use complex words or phrases she would need a translator.

E.g. when speaking to people from the city council, she would be need some assistance bc of the terminology they would use. She’s not hopeless but considering how long she has been here, I just think she could have done more. 

P.s. she’s fluent in Italian tho lol",1548355761.0,not the asshole,5654,672.0,0,"AITA for getting annoyed at my mum for not trying to learn the language of the country she has lived in for 20 years?

  Since I moved out for college I have started to open up and develop myself personally while also growing some pretty solid opinions on the stuff that matters to me (eg: cooking, health and lifestyle, socializing etc.) I was not the most open with my mom either but I'm making an effort to call her at least every two days and show her how I really am and what I stand for.

My Sis has always been heavily coddled all her life, whilst I have been left to fend for myself. Eg- My parents forced me to get a job at 14; from there on I was forced to pay rent, was fully financially responsible for myself and expected to do my own cooking/cleaning. I funded my own way through High school and univeristy, and was independant financially, but still controlled by my parents (they loved grounding me so I could do their cleaning as well). My sister struggled to get a job, didn't get one until she graduated from Uni, all the while I was funding her social life whilst I was still in high school. When she did get a job (earning 70k p/y), my parents decided she did not have to pay any rent or pay money she owed, as she 'did her time struggling', and deserved time to be free. To this day, she still does not pay for a cent; her money goes towards trinkets and clothes.

Through all this, I had been saving for a car the entire time, and was eager to drive. However my parents were strictly against allowing me to drive, as they essentially didn't want to give me any freedom. They cut my phone when I tried to book driving lessons & banned me from driving. One time I spoke with a friend about buying their car, they forbade me from ever speaking to that friend again.  


I moved out a few yrs ago. It was very sudden, and due to my parents views, I was briefly disowned. Nowadays I'm more active with my fam and working on the strained relationship. My sis barely speaks to me however; in her eyes as I moved out first (she still lives at home), I 'robbed' her of her right to move out first. My family has become way less disfunctional since I left; my leaving seemed to be a wake up call for their behaviour. I'm sad they couldn't be the family I needed, but I'm happy that things are working out for them. There is one thing that bothers me. My parents have changed their views on driving, & not only taught my sis to drive, but paid for most of her new car. She earns a lot, does not pay for anything & did not need the financial assistance for a car. 

I visited for my birthday; the entire day was spent flaunting the features of her car and how they paid for it for her. I called them out publically and loudly for their behaviour and their treatment of me, stormed out of the place and refused to go back. They accused me of being the asshole and insisted that I was making things up for attention, and insisted I was ruining my sister's ""special treat"". To this day insist I am a **massive** asshole for my reaction as I made them feel & look bad infront of everyone whilst they are trying to right their wrongs & work on things.

I'm sad they couldn't be the family I needed, but I'm happy that things are working out for them. There is one thing that bothers me. My parents have changed their views on driving, & not only taught my sis to drive, but paid for most of her new car. She earns a lot, does not pay for anything & did not need the financial assistance for a car. 

I visited for my birthday; the entire day was spent flaunting the features of her car and how they paid for it for her. I called them out publically and loudly for their behaviour and their treatment of me, stormed out of the place and refused to go back. They accused me of being the asshole and insisted that I was making things up for attention, and insisted I was ruining my sister's ""special treat"". To this day insist I am a **massive** asshole for my reaction as I made them feel & look bad infront of everyone whilst they are trying to right their wrongs & work on things.

I haven't heard anything anymore about her being a bit mad at me behind my back.

Hi guys,

I (35M) have been working at an analytics department for over 7 years at a big company located in The Netherlands. I have a pregnant co-worker (24F-25F) who will be having her baby near October. She wants to go get these classes on how to take care of babies and so on and she also wants to go see some kind of herbalist weekly for these herbs that should reduce nausea when pregnant.

She works everyday from 10 a.m till 5 p.m. I work from Monday till Thursday and get a day off at Friday because of my seniority at the office. Wednesdays i start from 7 a.m but i get to leave at 2 p.m.

My coworker has asked me repeatedly (and is still asking seriously) if i could sub in for her Wednesdays and Fridays during September. Wednesdays are her appointments with the herbalist and Fridays is when she will be taking the classes.

First time she asked me if i could cover her shift instead mine on Wednesday so she could go to the herbalist. I asked her back: ""Why would u need the entire day off for an appointment with the the herbalist  ?"" She told me that the herbalist is too far away for her too make it back in time for her shift. Then i asked the address of the herbalist and she said that it was located somewhere in Belgium.

I said i would think about it, and immediately after she asked me if i could also cover her shift on Friday.

NOTE: I get paid on Friday, no matter what. If i come to work or not it doesn't matter.

After that I immediately refused both her requests. She asked if i had plans and I said that I didn't but that I just wouldn't want to give up my free time for her and that I didn't want to change my schedule for her

She wasn't mad but she a made snarky remark that I laughed off so it wasn't that bad.

After that a long term best-friend of mine and co-worker came by and said some pretty bad things about me (in specific, the way I reacted at her. She didn't insult me personally is what my friend told me) at his department. And that his co-workers from his department agreed with her.

I left home and I felt pretty bad about it.

Carrie might be addicted to love and online dating. She has ALL of the apps. When I used to go over her apartment, she would want to just sit and swipe. She's extremely harsh on men (they need to be a certain type, make a certain amount of money, want to live a Christian lifestyle, want kids, etc). She has said to me on numerous occasions that she NEEDS to find a man and settle down ASAP, as her main priorities are being a wife and a mother. I know her intentions are good, but she comes across as crazy. She says she hates being alone and that it's not fair, that I'm lucky to have someone, etc. (For context, yes, I've dated my fair share of guys throughout college and post college. I've done the Tinder/Bumble thing. My current boyfriend and I have been together for a year; we live together, and both of us talk about marriage/a future together. I *know* I am lucky and happy). I've tried to tell her to focus on herself and to tone it down, but she's not great at taking criticism, even when I offer it calmly and constructively.

Carrie has this cycle in which she meets a guy on an app, they date for 1-2 months, she becomes obsessed, the guy gets freaked out, and usually ghosts her. She will then text/call him wondering what happened, asking for closure. This has probably happened 8 times now. I have been understanding all of those times, until the most recent one.

Carrie had been dating this guy, Mike, for about 5 weeks. Things seemed to be going well, but he stopped talking to her. She couldn't understand why. I had seen this same cycle with her so many times before. So I spoke my mind and told her I thought she was a relationship addict and needed to worry about herself and take a break from dating. I even sent her an article, something along the lines of ""7 Signs You're Addicted to Relationships,"" which was probably a little much on my end. She was like, ""Well, I don't identify with any of those things."" I was like, ""Carrie, you're like at least 5 of them."" She got mad and told me I was being a bitch. I explained that I was really tired of dealing with her constant breakups.

&#x200B;

I (23F) live in a city where the mass transit is pretty good. Occasionally I get a Lyft if I am going somewhere unfamiliar or I need to get there fast.  I was planning on going on a date to a bar a few nights ago, but both of us got out of work late and were pretty tired.  Instead, we planned a spa-night at his place. I decided that since I didn't know how to get from his apartment to the subway, even though they're close, I would get a Lyft since it was getting late.

I got picked up at my house by a male driver who was maybe 30 and there were two other women in the car.  It was a fairly pleasant ride while the other two were there--lots of great conversation about where we were all from, what we all do, etc. I mentioned my date and how excited I was for it. About 5-10 minutes from my drop-off, the other two get out.

Immediately I could feel a massive change in tone and energy in the car. We stopped at a light and he started to turn around to look at me, saying how much he liked me, how great he thought I was, that he could use more people like me around. I mumbled a ""thanks"" and tried to change the subject. I really thought I had made it clear I was not interested, but uncomfortable.

I thought he past my drop-off and I texted my date saying he needed to wait for me in the lobby, then opened the app to make sure he was on track.  I'm not sure if he actually did take a longer route, but we were on track by the time I looked. I was ready to get out if we weren't.

He pulls up really slowly to the apartment building, asking if ""it was cool if we stay in contact"" and go out. I blurted out that my boyfriend wouldn't like this and ran to the building. He didn't pull away until my date opened the second door on the inside of the building for me.

I told him what happened in detail and he was LIVID. He said I should report this, that it was harassment and that this man was in a power position over me. He was easily twice my size and was driving me around a part of town I was unfamiliar with.  I kept saying no, I didn't want him to get in trouble and I would feel bad. He stood firm and said that if this man had done it before, he would definitely do it again.

It has been a few days and I still feel really icky about it. It put such a damper on my night. I know it is dramatic, but it took me awhile to come down from it and relax.  All I wanted was to have a nice night with this really great guy, and I was uncomfortable for like an hour before I could completely calm down and enjoy it. I'm not even comfortable enough to use Lyft anymore.

I really don't want to ruin this guys life. WIBTA if I reported this incident to Lyft?

As I was going to bed pretty late that day, I sent him a text asking him if it was all finished or what was the story. He said it was over, he had been home for a few hours now  and was now getting ready to go out for drinks. 

That's it. No details on how it went, no thanks again for the help, no ""I'll tell you all about it tomorrow"".   
I was a bit hurt. I left him alone for the night and the next day because \*I know\* it's HIS day, but I kinda lashed out next night. He said he really didn't want to talk about the event, was tired and just wanted to go out and have fun, which is fair but I don't think a text message would had killed him.

So it has been 6 weeks since my last post and a lot has changed! The general consensus from people on here was that everyone sucked in the situation, and the best thing to do would be to find a new place. 

After the initial annoyance of realising we would have to find a new place I contacted my employer to ask if my bf and I could move to a new place since they pay for our accommodation, citing some unelaborated ‘challenges’ as being reason for moving. 

However my bf and I were away for a week when I sent the email, and my employer ended up telling Amy we were wanting to move out before we had the chance. 
I received a message from my Amy and apologised for not telling her and we spoke to her about it when we were back. My bf and I didn’t go into any detail with her about why we were leaving due to the fact that we work together, but also in past observations of her she doesn’t take ownership for her behaviour and can’t admit when she’s wrong. 

Now my bf and I are living on our own in a really nice, modern studio apartment that has sea views and we can hear the ocean from our room. So peaceful. I am also now realising our relationship was on the brink before we moved out on our own due to my anger and the lack of privacy. Now I’m the happiest I’ve been in our relationship. 

As well as this since my original post, a few weeks ago I contacted a good friend/ex flatmate of Amy with my concerns about her. This friend then told me she was treated in exactly the same way by Amy, and feels mentally more positive knowing it is Amy who is the problem.
Also (and the reason I posted this today) my boss came to me this afternoon and brought up a huge raft of concerns she is having about Amy as an employee. My boss said she’s always in the office demanding things, she is pushy, expects a lot from them, isn’t doing her job tasks properly and asks to leave work early because she apparently has no work to do - while the rest of us leave late trying to keep up with all the work. 

Since having some space and now speaking to other people about Amy, I am realising she’s not someone I can consider a true friend. However I will remain polite to her while I have to be around her still.

I’ve seen this guy doubled over & almost in tears because of it. He makes a noise vaguely resembling a wolf with its genitals caught in a mousetrap. JC also gets horrendous liquid fury from both mouth & anus, as my poor toilet has experienced many times. He still eats it, which is pretty annoying. 

Our group had a gathering at ED’s house and she had made food for us. She made some pate served on toast & a bunch of other mini dishes - all which had gluten. She apologised as she had forgotten that JC couldn’t eat it. Seeing as he is majorly head over heels, he says regardless he would try one. Immediately, I had the mental image of him fleeing to the bathroom with liquid destruction blasting out of both ends. I gave him a firm “don’t you fucking dare” glance and he retracted his hand. 

ED goes into a lengthy discussion about the food she made and how grateful she is for us trying it. I quickly pass out as much of it as I can to stop JC giving into his desperation to impress ED. The only bits left are 3 slices of mini toast and toppings. JC declared he will still eat it and didn’t care if he died. Usually I wouldn’t have cared if he wanted to coma himself via gluten, but I was his ride home and I knew the burden would be on me to take care of him.

I quickly grabbed the bread, shovelled one into my mouth and crushed the remaining 2 in my hands. 

JC became FURIOUS. He led me outside and screamed in my face that I had embarrassed him and I had no business to control what he ate. ED later told me she’s glad I stopped him as he would have definitely been in an awful state if he had eaten the food.

Yesterday, things finally came to a head when she tried manipulating my dad and my sister and she got herself involuntarily committed in a hospital.

She spent half the day alternating between screaming at my dad over the phone and my sister, blaming her for everything. This event will most likely stay with my sister for the rest of her life. She continuously tells my sister she’s too fat for her prom dress, basically leaving my sister an anxious mess with no self esteem. My dad tried reassuring her that she looks amazing (she does), my mom proceeded to tell my sister my dad lied when he said that.

I’ve had my issues with my mom but this situation made it crystal clear to me how terrible of a person she is.

80175,80175,e3e2td,1575030081.0,AITA for refusing to give piano lessons to a student that cancels often?,"OK so a bit of context:

I'm a 26 years old female, and I've been teaching piano for the past 6 years.  
My first student, Jess, and her parents are the ones I have issues with now.

When I began teaching I was desperate for more students and I told them that I'd appreciate if they could refer me to others. I also promised a 10% discount for the rest of the year, to incentivize them.   
They did refer me to someone shortly after and I provided the discount as promised.  
Over the years they referred me to a few more students - like 5 or so.

Here's the issue though.   
For the past six months they've cancelled a lot of lessons. And after not wanting to learn the entire summer, I've approached Jess's parents and asked them whether Jess still wants to continue piano. I've also discussed it directly with Jess as she's now 14. I suggested that since she's not always in the mood, we can have a lesson every few weeks when I have time but they said she'd like to continue as usual.  
It's probably useful to mention that Jess hasn't progressed a lot since she doesn't practice. I've raised this issue with her parents several times over the years, and they said they're okay and asked me not to push her to practice. We came to a mutual agreement that her lessons would be more of a creative outlet rather than perfecting a musical skill.

It's been 16 weeks since we talked in which they've cancelled five times. (only once was because they were away)  
This week they cancelled me again just 24 hours before the lesson. I said that we'll have to reschedule the lesson for another time or otherwise I'll have to charge them for late cancellation as it's time lost for me.   
They were annoyed and requested to cancel all the weeks in which there's no school in advance and sent me 18 dates.  
Adding weeks I'm away or that Jess might be sick, it comes down to having 30 lessons a year when I normally have 40+ lesson on average with my students. With $30 a lesson that makes a big difference for me.  
So I told them I wouldn't be able to keep Jess's weekly lesson anymore. They got really upset and said she wants to learn but wants a full break when there is no school. I said that I understand and suggested (again) to come over every few weeks when she does want to have a lesson with me. They were pretty shocked that I refused and said no other tutor has ever reacted that way and that it's totally normal to cancel on school breaks. This wasn't the case in previous years with them though. They also acted as if I owe them, saying that I gotta remember that they helped me by referring me to a few of my other students. I told them that while I appreciate their help, it's got nothing to do with it, and also reminded them that I gave them a discount in return.

6350,6350,9z7cpg,1542834415.0,AITA for not wanting a second date with a woman who lied about being trans?,"Sorry about the wall of text.

Some background: I'm a 25 year old bisexual cisgender woman. I've been out for about 8 years now and have been actively involved in the local LGBTQIA+ community. While I've never been in a serious relationship with a trans person, I've had friendships and casual sexual encounters with both trans men and women before. Generally speaking, if you're attractive, healthy, in decent shape, and we get along well, I'm happy.

I have a profile on a popular dating app and a really pretty lesbian (we'll call her Claire) sent me a message last week. We hit it off well and when I was reading her profile, it said, ""Cisgender woman"" as her gender. She was definitely my type physically, and after we flirted, sent each other sexy pictures, etc. we set a date to see each other on Friday. Date went well, we had a fun night at a club, and then we went back to Claire's place. As we're walking back from the subway, we were talking dirty to each other and given some of the stuff I said, like I couldn't wait to taste her pussy, etc. it was pretty clear what my expectations were at this point. As we were getting naked, she unzips her dress and I see she's wearing pads on her hips, a waist cincher, and when she takes off her panties, she has a penis. I didn't care about any of that beyond the fact that this whole time I thought she was a cisgender lesbian and that she had never once mentioned that she was trans, even after what we were saying to each other on the walk back from the subway. I've never had a trans partner hide their transgender status from me before, and to be honest, I was hurt that she hadn't said anything earlier. She saw that I was surprised and goes, ""What? Something wrong?""

I stammered a bit because it was unexpected and said, ""N-no, I just didn't expect-"" and I could see her get REALLY mad. 

""What's wrong? You're obviously pissed! Spit it out! Are you one of those TERFs?!"" (trans-exclusionary radical feminist, basically a feminist who believes that transgender woman are just men and can never be a 'real' woman).

Obviously there was no salvaging the night at this point and said, ""No, I'm not, your profile said you're cis, so I wasn't expecting-"" and Claire screams at me that of course it says she's cis, she can't say she's trans for her own safety, that I don't understand what it's like being trans, that people have threatened to kill her, that she needed to know she could trust me before she said anything, that I was privileged because I can say I'm bi on a public dating profile and not risk someone wanting to kill me, etc. I tried to defend myself by saying that I didn't care about her being trans and that I was just surprised, and she accused me of lying, saying obviously I care a lot or I wouldn't have said anything, that I had been lying when I said I was excited to go down on her earlier that night, etc. After our fight, we're both upset, in tears, and she tells me to get dressed and get out.

The thing is, I know she's partially right: I'm not trans, I don't know what it's like to be trans, all the social issues that come with being trans etc. I also can't help but be upset that she never once bothered to tell me, even as we were walking to her apartment from the train station. I totally get not being up front about it with a stranger, but if we're going home together and you trust me enough to be alone with you in your apartment, why wouldn't you say it then? I felt like if she couldn't be up front with me about that, what else wasn't she up front with me about?

After the weekend, I log onto my dating app, and there was a message from Claire waiting for me. She said she's sorry, that she overreacted, should have said something, etc. and that she wanted a second date to make it up to me. The thing is, I wasn't interested anymore as I felt like I couldn't trust her. I declined, and she called me a transphobic piece of shit and blocked me on social media and we haven't spoken since. 

Questions that have been rattling in my brain the past couple days: Was it wrong for me to feel hurt for her not telling me her trans status before we went home to have sex? Am I being ignorant? Was I in the wrong for turning down another date after she apologized? Should I have given her a second chance? AITA in this?

**TL;DR Went on a date with a woman who said she was cis on her dating profile. She's transgender and I didn't know until we were getting naked at her apartment. We had a fight over it, she apologized a couple days later and asked for a second date, but I didn't think I could trust her anymore and declined.** ",False,not the asshole,132,109.0,0,"AITA for not wanting a second date with a woman who lied about being trans?

As we're walking back from the subway, we were talking dirty to each other and given some of the stuff I said, like I couldn't wait to taste her pussy, etc. it was pretty clear what my expectations were at this point. As we were getting naked, she unzips her dress and I see she's wearing pads on her hips, a waist cincher, and when she takes off her panties, she has a penis. I didn't care about any of that beyond the fact that this whole time I thought she was a cisgender lesbian and that she had never once mentioned that she was trans, even after what we were saying to each other on the walk back from the subway. I've never had a trans partner hide their transgender status from me before, and to be honest, I was hurt that she hadn't said anything earlier. She saw that I was surprised and goes, ""What? Something wrong?""

I stammered a bit because it was unexpected and said, ""N-no, I just didn't expect-"" and I could see her get REALLY mad. 

""What's wrong? You're obviously pissed! Spit it out! Are you one of those TERFs?!"" (trans-exclusionary radical feminist, basically a feminist who believes that transgender woman are just men and can never be a 'real' woman).

Obviously there was no salvaging the night at this point and said, ""No, I'm not, your profile said you're cis, so I wasn't expecting-"" and Claire screams at me that of course it says she's cis, she can't say she's trans for her own safety, that I don't understand what it's like being trans, that people have threatened to kill her, that she needed to know she could trust me before she said anything, that I was privileged because I can say I'm bi on a public dating profile and not risk someone wanting to kill me, etc. I tried to defend myself by saying that I didn't care about her being trans and that I was just surprised, and she accused me of lying, saying obviously I care a lot or I wouldn't have said anything, that I had been lying when I said I was excited to go down on her earlier that night, etc. After our fight, we're both upset, in tears, and she tells me to get dressed and get out.

The thing is, I know she's partially right: I'm not trans, I don't know what it's like to be trans, all the social issues that come with being trans etc. I also can't help but be upset that she never once bothered to tell me, even as we were walking to her apartment from the train station. I totally get not being up front about it with a stranger, but if we're going home together and you trust me enough to be alone with you in your apartment, why wouldn't you say it then? I felt like if she couldn't be up front with me about that, what else wasn't she up front with me about?

After the weekend, I log onto my dating app, and there was a message from Claire waiting for me. She said she's sorry, that she overreacted, should have said something, etc. and that she wanted a second date to make it up to me. The thing is, I wasn't interested anymore as I felt like I couldn't trust her. I declined, and she called me a transphobic piece of shit and blocked me on social media and we haven't spoken since. 

Questions that have been rattling in my brain the past couple days: Was it wrong for me to feel hurt for her not telling me her trans status before we went home to have sex? Am I being ignorant? Was I in the wrong for turning down another date after she apologized? Should I have given her a second chance? AITA in this?

**TL;DR Went on a date with a woman who said she was cis on her dating profile. She's transgender and I didn't know until we were getting naked at her apartment. We had a fight over it, she apologized a couple days later and asked for a second date, but I didn't think I could trust her anymore and declined.** ",25.0,

Recent events:

1. My wife and I have been married for 6 years
2. We've had issues but worked through a lot of them
3. One big issue is financial. I've had career difficulty.
4. She was in residency to be a doctor for the past 3 years and got a job in a small town where her family lives. (pop:15k) Then I found a job here.
5. While we were getting ready to move, we realized that our relationship has run its course.

She has asked me to move out of town three times. Here are her reasons:

1. I came to this town to be close to her family. Because this was the reason I initially came here, she says that should be the reason I leave.
2. Her family comes from a very conservative country where divorce is deeply shunned. She said she is feeling pressure from her parents to stay married, and me being here exasperates it.
3. We signed a lease together and it's difficult to find apartments in this small town. I'm living in the apartment and  she is living with her family for now, but she wants her own place ASAP.
4. She thinks it is going to be too hard for her to see me around town
5. She has ""bent over backwards"" so much in terms of our marriage (it's complicated, but I'd say that's reasonably accurate) that I should consider bending over backwards for her.
6. My family is located in the midwest, and so most of my high school and college friends.

**I'm not against moving across the country, it's more I'm against moving out within the next month or so, as she is asking.** Here's why:

1. I'm actually loving this small town. I have gone to some meetups and meetings and met some new friends, and there's lots of stuff to do here that I enjoy.
2. I'm willing to work out the logistics in terms of apartments and leases so she can have this apartment.
3. I'm willing to shop at a different grocery store out of the way, etc.
4. As previously mentioned, I've been in a tough spot financially. While I am now actively looking for work in other regions, I'm very hesitant to move without a job in place first.
5. This small town is centrally located between 3 dream companies in nearby cities that I was hoping to network with and eventually get a career with within the next few years. This is primarily an east-coast industry and there is nothing in the midwest. (NOTE: there are entrepreneurial opportunities for me anywhere.) (ALSO NOTE: I'm not just looking at these jobs)
6. I agree I have never ""bent over backwards"" for my wife, which would mean giving up on or severely delaying my career ambitions to find higher salaries in careers I don't care about. I see how my stubbornness contributed to my divorce. However, now that we are separating I feel I am under no obligation to ""bend over backwards"" in terms of giving up potential career opportunities here to go back to the midwest, merely for her benefit.

So there you have it, reddit.

I await your judgment.

**EDIT:** Some of you seemed to think I am staying in the hopes we'll get back together. Right now it feels virtually impossible, and I'm OK with that. Like I said, I think our relationship has run its course. I should clarify: I am 90% sure I am going to relocate in a year or so. But there's so much going on I can't see that far ahead, so I am just taking it day by day, one step at a time. I am actively looking for work elsewhere, and if I get something good I'll relocate sooner.

Long time lurker, first time poster (well story wise anyways). Please excuse the grammar.

Context: I'm a 22 year old female who has little experience baby sitting  or with kids in general (relevant) My bf is 24 and has a 3 year old son.

Several months ago, my boyfriend started working to get custody of his 3 y/o son. Our lives changed with this new person in our life. For a while, life was hard for my bf because that meant everything evolved around his son now. We could no longer go out to bars and get drunk like before. I was happy for him.

Before his son was beginning to settle in our lives, bf had asked me for a favor. And that was to watch his son and take care of him while he was gone (normally for less than 2 hours on Saturdays). This turned into bf asking me to do almost everything during the weekend when we had him, taking the kid potty, feeding him and watching him more. I would have been okay with it, my bf's job was harder than mine and I understand he's tired and all. However, I couldn't help but feel annoyed that he asked me to do these things while he sat on the bed all day and played video games the entire day if we didn't go out. His son could yell "" I need to go potty!"" at him and he wouldn't stop gaming, just tell me to do it. I really tried to be okay with this. ""*it's the weekend, bf has been working and going to school all day, he gets to reward himself*"" I thought that to myself over and over.  I can't say I've been a saint and didn't argue or give bf attitude for it though.

2 months ago, bf's son, was allowed to live with us, as a trial. This meant someone needed to watch him while my bf was at school during the late evenings( Monday through Thursday). The babysitting included watching the kid play video games (helping him a lot), feeding him,taking him potty, taking him a shower, getting him dressed, brushing his teeth and putting him to bed. This went from weekdays only to every single day. Then I was told to start getting the kid ready in the morning before if was time to take him to daycare (even when I had to wake up at 4 AM to get ready for work). Overtime this became tiring, emotionally. I started feeling unappreciated at times. There were hardly any thank yous, hugs or anything to show gratitude.  He said I was doing the bare minimum and I agreed to do it so I need to do it.

Today I told him I didn't feel like this whole situation was what I wanted in a relationship. I was frustrated and I regret telling him that at all. He got upset with me and we aren't on good speaking terms at the moment.

I really need some advice. I understand that I agreed help, but am I in the wrong for feeling frustrated at the lack of gratitude? Am I doing too much or too little?

I've known Logan since Fall of last year since he and Nat were in the same class. Logan seemed like a great kid. However a few months ago, he started acting out a bit. Having had trouble keeping the post brief, I'll list three different times I noticed a change in Logan's behavior. 

1. At first, I assumed it was a ""boy being a boy"" thing. Whenever he would come over he and Nat would pretend to be wrestlers or something like that. Nat would tell me over dinner that whenever he was playing outside, Logan would try to get everyone to punch each other until they bled. I told him they all had to play more nicely. 

2. A week later, the group of kids were together as usual and I was taking a walk around the neighborhhood. All seemed well but then I could hear a kid cussing up a storm. It turned out to be Logan. I approached him to ask him what was going on (he ran off soon after) and my son and the other friends were telling me they were playing tag and he didn't want to be tagged at all. Later that night, I walked down to Logan's house to talk to his mom and during the conversation she seemed nonchalant and nodded quite a bit and said sorry. I said, no it's fine. We said goodbye and that was that. After that, it was apparent that Logan could only play at his house. A month went by and the 2nd grade was almost over for the boys. Nat told me one day that Logan wasn't being nice to him and some of their friends in class anymore. I said that he should just avoid him for a while. I asked if Logan was being physical, Nat said no, just calling them names. I said that he could talk to his teacher about it, too, if it ever got bad.

3. Several days later, Nat and Logan got off the bus together and asked if Logan (who also apologized to me) could come over. I reluctantly said yes, called his mom to tell her he would be over at our place, and she said that's fine. Later, I was doing paperwork at the kitchen table while the kids were in the living room playing with my sons' Legos. I think they built a tower and Logan had kicked it over. Nat and Paul screamed, ""HEY!!"". Logan then slapped Paul on the side of his neck, who then started to cry and ran upstairs. I said, okay, that's it and took Logan by the hand into my home office to call his mom. This time she seemed annoyed but at me. She asked why I didn't put him in time out and I said, well, he's not my kid and thought it best that he go back home so everyone could cool off. She accused me of singling him out and that kids play like that all the time. I said that they shouldn't be slapping each other, though, and that this wasn't the first time Logan was being rude. She sort of chuckled and said she'll pick him up, then hung up. She came by 10 minutes later took him home.

That night she was working behind the bar but she had texted me that they had a small booth still not reserved and I could get it for cheap with bottle service. She's hooked me up like that before and I hopped on it. NYE, booth, bottle service. Surely a packed house, and I'll have a reserved seat. I was all over it. Not going to lie and as a single dude it's a nice little setup to talk to women that have mutual interest.

So, I'm mingling by the bar with this group of 3 girls who are all friends. We are having a decent enough conversation and they are talking about how they are all from out of town from California and one girl was from Willow Creek. At this point we literally say, ""the home of Bigfoot.""(I'm a bit of a conspiracy theory nut) After this we all laugh, and such then I jokingly say, ""that's it *ALL* drinks on me for Bigfoot's neighbors."" We all laugh and then I motion for my friend to come over then I buy a round of drinks on my tab.

After the drinks I moved back to my booth and didn't talk to them anymore. I did see they had met a group of three guys and they looked like they had joined up. But, more drinks. More fun. Countdown. All that jazz. Later in the night I'm talking to another woman in the booth. And, I can see the three girls darting straight towards me. 

Apparently, one of the girls had opened a tab and went to close out because they were leaving then got hit with something like a $1,200 bar tab. They were buying drinks all night thinking I was going to pay for it all and my friend was putting on their tab not mine. They wanted me to go up to the bar and explain the situation. I told them I wouldn't because that was obviously a joke that I would pay for all their drinks and I hadn't seen them all night and barely knew them there's no way I'm paying that.

They called me an asshole and all kinds of names I could barely believe. My favorite was the insulting of my wiener size. The woman I was sitting with left to get away from the drama and at this point security steps in telling them to chill out or get kicked out. They leave me alone and I sneak out when I'm ready to leave to avoid anymore drama with them.

But, I'm conflicted I really don't think I owed them anything but I guess in an alternate universe I can understand thinking they had a blank check... maybe? I don't know. Even with a blank check I would have gotten a few drinks. Not the bottles and so on they got.

I have done as much as I can to include him in things that require spending money by offering to cover it (I wanted to have the experiences together), always been understanding when he can't be around because of working odd jobs on weekends to keep his finances stable, those types of things.

Picture of said cat.

http://imgur.com/gallery/M48fxsH

Ok, here's the situation. I've been living in my current house about 8 months. There's a cat that basically lives in the house, except no one in the house actually owns him. I figured he might be a stray, but to be sure I put a paper tag on him the next time he went out, and ended up getting in touch with his owner.

Here's the thing. He is talking bullshit. The cat has been living here pretty much full time for months.

He sleeps in my room pretty much every night. And I'm only here 8 months, this has been the case since the initial housemate got here 3 years ago.

This cat and I are homies. I pay for his food, worm him, check him for ticks and mites and I was planning on bringing him for a check up before I found out the owner existed. He waits for me outside every day when I get home from work. He literally spends all his time in our place. He sleeps on my back. He's my fucking cat.

We got served notice on our tenancy recently, and the thought of leaving this cat is breaking my fucking heart. I've tried to explain the situation to him as best he can but I can only meow in the key of Eb so I'm not sure if he understands entirely.

Newbie here. I'm biracial [20F] and live in the country that my mother is from with both of my parents. English is used often here but most of the population also speak the native language (some only speak the native language). My mother only spoke English to me growing up, and the nature of this language is that it's far easier to pick up as a child than trying to learn it later in life.  I struggled to learn it in primary school and decided to learn French in high school instead, which I picked up way faster. As a result I really want to learn more French as well as Italian and Portuguese. It seems more relevant to me because the languages are widely spoken internationally whereas only people from this country speak the language. 

The reason I don't want to learn the native language is that people here, including my extended family, are really rude about it. Everyone believes that if you're from here you have to know the language and if you don't know it you don't have a claim to this nationality. Also, people here can be racist. I don't speak the language but I can understand it, and people often point out that I'm ""white"" (they say the equivalent in the language) whenever I'm speaking English at the home village or just in public places.

At this point, I don't even want to know what they're saying. I don't want to learn the language of people who don't even think I belong here because of my skin tone or the way I speak.

Socially not being a comfortable presence in the room

Moments of crying downstairs uncontrollably due to a high level of stress and depression

Certain moments of lashing out at us due to her own personal issues

Not accepting that things may be deteriorating.

My other girl roommate is stating there is a clear sign of gaslighting occurring between the two of them. Betty, who is much older, has asked this girl to not interact with Betty's friends when she is not present, made unbecoming comments of this girl's appearance, and believes that they are supposed to be really great friends while primarily taking up this girl's time for her own needs. Basically overall a shitty friendship relationship with poor ass communication on both parts. Their relationship now stands completely broken with Betty thinking she can fix it and the other girl not wanting to live with her, and considering moving out herself.

My other guy roommate has this genuine feeling of unease around her. He has stated ""I am not comfortable sometimes coming in the front door of my own house"". This is the nicest guy around and the person who brought Betty into the mix. He has expressed that this is not a good fit.

With both of my other roommates expressing it's not a good fit (put lightly), along with me for the most part not seeing eye to eye with this woman, I felt that it was important that I communicate to her that I didn't think this 6 month old housing situation was any longer a good fit.

I offered to help her find a new place and do whatever I could do to smooth the transition. I figure it's good to get it in the open.

She said no. My other guy roommate has on his own asked the same of her at this point. Regardless of that, she has communicated she feels it isn't fair and that we have bullied her (probably have at this point just by all of us expressing our issue we have with her (separately)) and she wants to stay and fix this.

I'm in JH right now and my parents are going through a divorce. I'm not mad at that at all. As far as I've known, they've never gotten along and this was a long time coming. I live with my mom and spend every other weekend with my dad. I picked this arrangement out because even though I dislike him, my mom does think it's best for me to get along with my dad since you only get one dad and all. 

For what I've gathered eavesdropping on conversations whenever a family friend comes over, the divorce process is becoming more and more nasty with my dad claiming a lot of things against my mom that I know is false and he's apparently now asking my mom for spousal support since he got fired (he didnt actually, he quit). She tries not to show it in front of me, but I know it's taking a toll on her.

My partner is (Mel) and his partner is (Em). Its gotten to the point that both partners have their computers at our house, we're all massive gamers.

Yesterday i worked a 10 hour day and came home to the three of them in the lounge room on their computers, it was my turn to cook so i basically had to go from 10 hours of work into an hour of cooking so i was feeling pretty tired. I walked into the kitchen and saw that the dishes hadnt been done and the dishes from the last 36 hours were sitting their crusty and dry.

I wouldnt have normally made a big song and dance about it but i got home from a 10 hour shift at 7pm and was confronted with a huge mess, couple that with the idea that all three of them had been home all day, gaming and having fun while i was slogging away at work, i broke and word vomited at them. I ended up throwing out how i felt like an outsider because i'm not home nearly as much as they are because i have work, and pointing out how even outside of 
 working i seem to do the lionshare of the errand running and picking up incidental bills, which is fine but i'm also now missing the fun parts of living together 

I felt guilty as I was saying it because i know i work to get paid, its a tradeoff i choose to make, but that doesnt make me feel any less left out when by the time i'm free to do something they're generally burnt out from gaming, so i lose any social time i could have had with them.

We sorted out a lot of things, they were going to pick up the slack around the house because i seem to do as much if not more then them even with a 6 day a week job. They also appreciated how the game we were all playing is something we've put huge hours into as a group and how it is a social thing for us all. I realised i had taken the role of dad in the house, sorting out a lot of the responsibilities and putting effort into keeping the house running, but missing the fun stuff because of it, and it left me feeling like i was the ""unfun"" friend in the group.

I couple months past and I didn’t hear any more about her. Until for some reason she came up in conversation. I said in a joking way “oh yea when you first got back you wouldn’t shut up about her” he then admitted to me that he had some feeling for her. It made me upset but he went on the trip towards the beginning of the relationship and this girl lived in another country. So I just let it go. 

Now Blake has gotten a new job and he’s been working there for the past month. He really enjoys it and I'm super happy for him.

I’ve heard about her almost every day for the past couple weeks and it’s starting to make me upset.  We had to discuss cheat and we agreed that we would never cheat and just end things. This was a genuine conversation. I trust him and I know he would never do such a thing. Blake is aware that I don’t like her and he knows that when he talks about her I get annoyed but just last night he was meant to come over to my house at around 5 and he didn’t show he texted me an hour later telling me that he’s just with his mate getting food. So I thought he’d be here in 30 minutes or so. 2 hours go by and he finally shows up. He knew I was annoyed I asked him who he was with. He was with his mate and the girl. I feel wrong to being that jealous girlfriend who doesn’t allow him to hang out with another girl. It’s just the sad thought in the back of my mind. So please tell me if I’m an asshole and that I should just let it go 
My apologies if my grammar is shit



Update: 
I realised I didn’t explain this but he has many girl-friends and I’m totally cool with him chilling with them. it was  just how this particular girl was being mentions all the time which got to me. I have I talk with him last night about how I feel about the whole situation and I think I was looking at it in the wrong way. On the boat trip with the girl he explained that he was small area with only about 50 people and limit areas to go in. It just happened. I understand how it was the beginning of the relationship and he still could of been confused with how he actually felt about me. Which is totally fine. And I think that the girl at his work is just a really cool person.

For a good reason So my partner let’s call him Blake went on a boat trip a few months back and came back telling me all these stories about his trip. I noticed with all these stories this one girl was always mentioned. I thought nothing of it until she was being mentioned and talked about all the time. I started getting a suspicion that he could have liked this girl but I kept that to myself 

I couple months past and I didn’t hear any more about her. Until for some reason she came up in conversation. I said in a joking way “oh yea when you first got back you wouldn’t shut up about her” he then admitted to me that he had some feeling for her. It made me upset but he went on the trip towards the beginning of the relationship and this girl lived in another country. So I just let it go.

52260,52260,clsopf,1564895687.0,WIBTA if I turned down a full ride to law school in order to go to a better-ranked one?,"My boyfriend and I are both planning to go to law school this upcoming fall. I got a full ride to a good law school and my boyfriend got a half ride to the same one. Until very recently, I had been fully committed to going to this law school, as I would be graduating debt-free and we would be able to attend school together. 

However, I recently got off the waitlist at a better law school and the offer is hard to turn down. It is regarded as one of the best in the country and my parents are absolutely ecstatic. However, my boyfriend is pretty pissed. 

He says that I would be putting us in a lot of debt (the school offers no scholarships, just need-based financial aid, which I DO qualify for) and that we would now be separated for three years. He also said I was TA for telling my parents, when I knew that they would be pressuring me to attend law school there. 

I really want to go to this law school. It is better aligned with what I want to do in life, and I want to make my parents happy. This sense of obligation is something that my boyfriend will not understand, because his parents basically left him to fend for himself after he turned 18, but my parents have contributed a significant amount to my undergraduate tuition, which, combined with scholarships and part time work, has allowed me to graduate debt-free. This means a lot to me as my parents are significantly less well-off than his, but they put their everything into making sure I had a good start in life. This is also a cultural thing. (I am Chinese-American.) 

Also, doing the math, combined with my savings, financial aid, and some living expenses help from my parents, I would be graduating law school with the same amount of debt as my boyfriend. In addition to this, he has around 30k in undergraduate debt that I do not have. I also let him know that should we get married, I would take on full responsibility for my student loans. 

I think I am going to accept the offer, but WIBTA if I did so? From my boyfriend’s perspective, I am putting our relationship and financial security in jeopardy, even though I have the option to avoid doing so. He also thinks I am being a kissass to my overbearing parents, but this is something that I want too, not just them.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the replies! I really wasn’t sure who was in the wrong here; I immigrated here when I was a child so I do think I am heavily influenced by China, and I wasn’t sure if my reasoning would be unacceptable by American standards. Also, just because there seems to be some confusion about the amount of debt I’d be taking on, it would not be the same amount as my boyfriend’s undergraduate loans (30k).

So, when they asked me to be in their wedding party, I gladly accepted. I got added to multiple group chats to organize the wedding party plans, and I made sure to keep up whenever somebody posted an update.

Fast forward a few months, two weeks before the wedding to be specific. My friend messages me telling me that they felt I hadn’t been “engaged enough” and they questioned whether I actually wanted to be in their wedding. I apologized and attempted to assure them that if my actions implied that I wasn’t interested that it was not my intention; I was genuinely excited about being a part of their special day. 

This friend gave no prior indication that they were upset or that they felt I hadn’t been engaged. It was only two weeks before the wedding that they chose to address it. At which point they decided they didn’t want me in their wedding anymore. I was seriously dumbfounded. I had no indication that anything was wrong, and the extent of involvement I could’ve had prior to the wedding was replying to the group chat, which I didn’t view as necessary because I didn’t see the majority of people actively participating. 

They didn’t particularly care for my apology or attempts to rectify the situation. They entirely ignored me and chose to remove me from all of the wedding party group chats. 

Following this, they sent me a message saying that they “hoped I would still attend as a guest.”  I replied saying that it would be humiliating and exhausting to show up and have so many people know that I was removed from the wedding party. So I updated my RSVP to indicate that I wouldn’t be attending.

But I'm not really convinced that IATA here. 


This dude kept creeping up from the rear of the queue for the parking garage. He was kinda meandering and a bit drunk. He seemed like a ""good ol boy"" type and was trying to engage a younger woman when I first noticed him in my peripheral vision about 4-5 feet to the rear right of me.


He started to get closer to me, like shoulder to shoulder. He was just standing there and looking at a few of the women in line and then just jumped up between me & the lady in front of me, who kinda had her head down. I thought she was trying to just ignore him rather than tell him to fuck off. 
He put his hand on her lower back and leaned into her ear to say something and she moved away and didn't really engage. So I'm thinking that this dude is just trying to schmooze his way up the line. 


Then he moved onto the next woman in front of him. Put his hand on her back and she kinda glanced at him but didn't say anything to him. Then he started to fucking slap her ass and makes each cheek jiggle. She's looking back at him and doesn't seem especially thrilled.

Edge: Fuck off

Me: damn, it was a damn joke, sorry 

Edge: I dont give a shit, stop being a prude.

At this point i was getting a bit angry when i shouldn't have. I was telling him to ""write his fucking wall of text"" and all this shit, i did get a bit out of hand and i regret it. Gay Best Friend is just reacting to everything while River is ya know being drunk and just saying stuff as another reaction. Edge blows up and here's a summery

Edge: I'm done with your childish and stupid behavior \[DEAD NAME\]. You have caused me and River so much stress and we are both done. You caused her to fail a semester because of your behavior. and by the way, its RIVER, not \[Nickname\]

Now at that point i just said ok ill leave then, and left the group. now here's where the dms come into play.

Me: Do you really hate me?

River(Edge on her phone): Yes. Now Leave. From yours truly, Edge.

Me: I'm talking to River right now

River(has her phone back): he took my phone

Me: ok, am i really a bad person? did i really cause you to fail. Tell the truth

River: Yes, Kenny. I have had enough with the drama and childish behavior from you. You have seriously caused Edge and I tremendous amounts of stress and problems.

Me: Then why didn't you talk to me about this earlier? Iv only been trying to be a good friend

Me: so basically what your saying is that if you came to me and talked to me about my behaviour in person I would cry my eyes out.
