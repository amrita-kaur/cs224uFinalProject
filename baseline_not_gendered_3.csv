14043,"WIBTA for taking markers away from children? I work in a government office and we have a cleaning crew who comes in after hours. We recently got a new crew and I have noticed that the dry erase markers I keep in a jar on my desk are always upside down, sometimes with the lids loose, when I get to my cube in the morning. So, I put them back the right way, but the next day, they’re disturbed again. This has been going on every day for about a week.

I don’t use these markers often, but I need them about once a month to update our office’s information board. I bought them with my own money as the state only provided black and brown markers.

I think what is happening is the cleaning crew brings their children and allows them to use my markers to color while the crew works. The kids don’t disturb anything else or color on my desk or state property.

I feel like I would look like an asshole for moving the markers into a drawer since they aren’t expensive and the kids don’t seem to be destructive. At the same time, I don’t want to have to buy new ones every other month because the kids leave the lids off or use them all up coloring their pages 5 days a week.

Would I be the asshole for hiding them? Should I leave a note or is that even more of an asshole thing to do?

Thanks for reading.",
60415,"WIBTA if I complained about my therapist for not doing her job right and treating me like a child and possibly cost her her job? For context I'm 18 and was going through intense trauma therapy.

I've had 3 sessions with this particular therapist. The sessions were supposed to be me reliving things that happened to me in hope of recovering from them. So far she has been 10 minutes late to two of the sessions and then the sessions have only lasted around 25 minutes. Each session should last for 50. She has also barely touched on trauma at all, save for giving me some websites to look at, and instead chose to focus on attempting to give me CBT for my depression.

Not only is my depression directly caused by my PTSD and illness but I had CBT for 2 years and it did nothing. I specifically told her at the start that CBT was out of the question and does not work for me.

Every session I've had she acts and sounds super condescending. Talking to me like I don't understand my own mind. Whenever I try to bring up the trauma she just says ""aww, that must have been really difficult. Now should we go back to this?"" In the sort of sing song voice you use to talk to a baby or a dog.

I want to scream at her. I want to slap her. I want to stop her treating people like this. I'm not going to but what I want to do is write to her employer. Explain everything to them however I have heard from other people in the community that she is on a final warning with her employer. I don't want to be responsible for ruining her career.",
19597,"AITA for cutting off people from my life for triggering my PTSD some background: So the people in this story are as follows: K - A long time friend. S - K's Girlfriend 

I'm on mobile so sorry for format

A few days ago I was getting ready for a dnd session as planned, when I got messages from half the people that they wouldn't be able to make it. That's no big deal. I have a one shot prepared, and all I need is another player. 

I had messaged K assuming she would want to play, and when she failed to respond for 15 minutes I hoped in the voice chat she, and S were talking in and asked her. S blew her top and muted me and started screaming that I was worthless and a piece of shit, not giving me a chance to defend myself. S knows fully well that this triggers my PTSD and I go non-verbal. Nobody can get a peep out of me once my flashbacks start. 

fast forward a few minutes after she stops yelling, and I manage to quell my flashbacks enough to pass off ownership of the server, and I leave. I promptly blocked the two of them, both K, and S, after K tried to guilt trip me that S was only joking around and that I need to grow up.

I then created a new server for everyone from my dnd game without K or S.

48662,"AITA if I ask my parents to cook more often? So every weekday, my parents would come back home around 1830-1900 and would ask me to go out to buy back dinner for them. The thing is, the place they expect me to buy from is about a 10 minute walk away from home and the food there is oily as fuck. Besides, I myself would have reached home around 1745-1800 (I usually stay back in school to study). The reason they give for not cooking is that ‘they are too tired after work to cook’, whereas I myself am also tired after being in school for about 10-11 hours a day.

The reason I want them to cook is because its:
1) healthier
2) I’m tired of eating oily af food

42258,"AITA for jabbing at a friend's insecurity because he wouldn't listen to me? So I have a friend that I play videogames with frequently. He's not bad at the games, but he does lose often. And when he does, he'll ask for a handicap. In Smash or any other fighting game for example, he'll throw his controller when he loses and get personally mad whenever anyone calls him out for being immature.

We were playing an open world game today, and I find out he's been cheating his way to the endgame and leaving us in the dust. I calmly say I don't want to play with someone cheating and leave. He texts me and gets extremely angry, saying I'm a righteous asshole for not wanting to play with him, and ignoring his offers to cut it out (because I was busy telling him why I'm not a fan of it). He begins to throw a pity party and says he wants to just play god and watch other people have a good time.

Because he was insistent on defending his cheating, I tell him that ""Cheating is bad. I think you'd learn that by now."" He cheated on his girlfriend a few months ago and it cost him his relationship.

51205,"AITA for saying hello to an Instagram “influencer” I unexpectedly ran into yesterday while with my girlfriend? So where to begin. Girlfriend and I are on vacation to Los Angeles area and I was actually planning on proposing tomorrow on Venice beach where we had something very special happen to us as a couple 4 years ago. Now I’m worried after yesterday it will seem insincere. 

Yesterday we got day passes to a gym in Long Beach to sort of recover from partying the night prior. I’ve been a fan of an Instagram “influencer” for a long time because she’s so anti-influecer. She’s all natural, is a trainer, has videos on how to make kombucha she cook, talks about all the companies she turns down who are unethical, etc... honestly she reminds me of my girlfriend and the only product I’ve ever bought from Instagram is a bikini that this girl modeled because I thought my GF Would look hot. 

So we were at the gym and it was like one of those in my head moments like “that can’t be her, it sure looks like her, but no that’s too random. No that’s her.” So i was doing 5x5 circuits set up next to the treadmill where my girlfriend was running. I didn’t want to disturb my girlfriend run so I went over to the Instagram girl and said like I hate to bother you but are you Angelica? She said yes and I said I was not meaning to be weird but I was a huge fan of her IG page and was shocked I ran into her. She was very sweet and said it was so nice of me to say hello and she’s worried she doesn’t get seen as much as the more obvious influencers. I told her no that she was awesome and she asked if we could take a pic for her page and I said yes she put her arm around me and took a selfie. We thanked each other and we went our separate ways. 

When I went back to the treadmills my girlfriend was gone. I know she had wanted to rub for an hour so I was like what the hell. So I looked all over the gym for her and nothing. I looked on findmyfriends and saw that she was maybe in the parking lot so I went to rental car and she was in there with the AC running. She asked me if I thought it was good idea to go “sprinting” across the gym to “hit on” another girl in front of her. I was like no, no she’s the girl who inspired me to get your boutine bikini. My girlfriend quipped back great that it didn’t make her feel better  I was willing to abandon her for a bikini model. I was like babe I didn’t abandon you, I was gone for 3 minute to say hello. She said I saw you with your arm around her so you did much more than say hello. I said that was for a selfie. She said again I’m an asshole and everything I say is making it worse because now it’s a selfie with a bikini model not just saying hello. I tried to talk again and she told me to “just shut the fuck and can we go?”

 We left but I ended up forgetting my phone so I dropped her off at the hotel and went back. When I got back she had left and met some friends for dinner and left me behind. She didn’t speak to me when she got back to the hotel and this morning was weird. 

Was I the asshole?",
13183,"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to watch a baby for the entire weekend almost every weekend for free? Long story short my girlfriend knew someone back in high school that was in a really bad spot due to drugs and things of that nature. That friend has since had 2 kids and has another one on the way and knows absolutely nothing about taking care of kids. She’s basically homeless and does not take proper care of her kids at all. 

My girlfriend has loved kids and wanted a baby for as long as she’s been able to walk. I admire that part about her very much. She fell in love with one of them and that baby just turned 1 year old. My girlfriend insists on taking her every weekend she has off work for most of the weekend. The mother is all too willing to not have to take care of one of her kids so that’s never a problem. 

I have a few issues with this. we live in a pretty small 1 bedroom apartment and have a dog as well. When she has the baby we have our dog locked up all day and night because she’s concerned about the baby. The apartment also gets absolutely trashed over the time that the baby is with us. She always says that she will clean it afterwords and she does most of the time but I can’t stand our home being a mess for that long. And tbh it’s just crowed with all of the babies stuff.  She also spends a lot of money on the baby on new clothes, food, diapers, equipment like bottles or high chairs.

She gets so much joy out of babysitting that when I object in any way she reacts like I’m destroying everything that makes her happy and that I want nothing more than for her to be miserable. I don’t have any problem with her babysitting for a day or something along the lines of that but 3 days straight seems excessive to me. 
 
__TL;DR__ AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to watch a baby all weekend in our small apartment even though it’s what she lives for?

61613,"AITA for giving my brother $1000 Throwaway account

I’m 18, in college. I’m on a full ride merit scholarship out of my home state. Today, I just got a refund because my financial aid covered more than my school expenses. It’s a little over 3k.

My brother (“P”) is 6 years older than me. He lives with our dad and our dad’s new family. P has 2 jobs and pays for his own expenses and rent.

P is an aspiring actor. He always been a charismatic, funny guy. High school was great, but at home life was different.

We lived with our r/raisedbynarcissists mother. P was physically and verbally abused. He was forced out of the house at 17 and then eventually moved in with our dad.

P and dad do not have really any type of relationship. He tries to say it’s okay, but P is always disappointed when he tries to start a relationship with our father and never gets any reciprocity.

About a year and a half ago, P was diagnosed with schizophrenia after having a psychotic episode and being admitted to a mental institution. He is still struggling with accepting that he needs to take medication to not spiral back into that hole.

He had to take breaks from school due to his mental state, and was unenrolled from school due to absences. 

On top of that, P has only worked night shifts at several part time jobs, had his bike stolen, was forced to give away his cat, and is in some trouble financially.

While we were on the phone, he says if he just had 1000 dollars, he would be able to fix so much of the shit on his plate. He’d be able to pay off his credit card bills, get a new bike and pay to travel to look for gigs. He says all he has to do is just work for it and he’ll be there, but he is tired of bad shit happening to him out of nowhere.

By the time he finishes, I tell him to check his PayPal because I sent him the money. No strings attached, just do what you need to do to steer yourself on track.

He immediately says “Why would you do this?” and is upset that I would send him that money, saying he “didn’t ask for it” and “doesn’t want [me] to pay for him”. It doesn’t matter how much I tell him that this isn’t out of pity or because I expect repayment, I just want him to know I believe in him. P tries sending it back, but I tell him no, but if he wants to send it back so badly, he can send me it out of his next couple of checks. He hangs up after a few minutes saying he “just needs to go” and will call me tomorrow.

In my eyes, I wouldn’t be where I am without my older siblings sacrificing for me and believing in me. My parents were never rooting for me, it was always P and our older sister. So now, I want to support P. He needs someone—anyone—to just be on his side.

Tl;dr:
I sent my aspiring actor brother $1000 to help him chase his dreams and get his life on track because I am in the position to do so and he has been struggling for a long time. He is upset because he didn’t ask for my help and wants to do the work himself.

AITA?

EDIT:
also just wanted to clarify that I am a little sister, not a little brother. not a huge deal, but idk if that would change anyone’s answer.",
14444,"AITA for being mad at my best friend for choosing her bf over me Right this person is my best friend (let's call her Casper) and I love her to bits but there has been a few concerns about our friendship. 

For some context Casper rarely ever sees me she is always at her bfs house (who is an ass) and I usually see her like 3/4 days a month 5 if I'm lucky. Before she went with him I saw her all the time so it was a bit of a change for me rarely Getting to see her. However when I do see her it's usually past 12 and only for a few hours. I was beginning to think maybe she only used me as a company source since at that time she has to do shopping at Asda for her mom and she would also always get me to bring her fags.
 (what I would do anyway but I got a bit wary once when she took a packet of tobacco that I bought and went to her bfs. I was left with 4 fags to last me 4/5 days and then she told me her mom binned it)

So recently it was supposed to be her birthday actually Tuesday is her birthday and two days ago her mom, me, her bf and her where supposed to go together to nandos.
On the Thursday before the Saturday she was at my house seeing the new kitchen, Getting a few fags off of me and playing some mario kart when her mom phoned my phone and told her her bf wanted to talk to her.

Here is the thing with her bf for some reason whenever she is at my house he starts and argument. Last time he made some thing up that she was cheating on him because he was on her Facebook and saw she sent her ex stepdad daughter an xx in messages. Her bf doesn't treat her nice either so I said to her why don't you tell him he has a month to buck up the way he acts or you're leaving him but don't let him know that he will still be tested for another 2 months afterwards. (This is the only thing I can think of for him to here me)

When he phoned he shouted at her saying he was worried about her being at mine so late (didn't didn't do this another time even when she's walking about at 3am coming From asda) then he brought me into it saying that I she is always at my house and that I am a twisted fucking cow and I was leading one of my ex pals on (I was friends and he still wanted to hang I told him I wasn't interested but since I was his friend I apparently am leading him on?) He said that Casper isn't allowed to hang out with me anymore and that Casper needs to buck up her ideas and be a ""good girlfriend"" he said she is 16 and she needs to grow up and then would say she wasn't an adult because she isn't 18.
He finally hit out with ""its either me and your mom or (my name)"" Casper said well obvs I'm gonna pick you and my mom and gave me this look like don't worry I don't mean it so I was okay and then he also said I'm not allowed to go to her birthday meal on Saturday. 
She motioned to me to roll her some fags and I did but I was too angry and upset to do it's right so she rolled herself some out of my baccy for going home idk how much but there was very little already in the packet so there wasn't much left. 
I was obviously in tears cause I thought Caspers mom didn't like me and that I couldn't see her again and more so because Casper was my only friend. 
This is what I find weird Casper knew I spent alot on her for her birthday I sent about £80 on her out of my own money and I get like £60 a fortnight. She asked me if she could get all of her gifts early since she didn't know the next time she will see me, so I was like sure but it just made me more upset that I couldn't give her her gifts on a better environment so I just broke down crying she told me she'd speak to her mom and her bf when she got home.

Thing is she didn't message me that night, so far she hasn't messaged me at all. Yesterday I sent her a message saying I'm here for her and it's not her fault he is a dick and she responded saying thanks but she needs to go since she is at his house using his mom's laptop and Caspers mom messaged saying that Casper will message me when she gets home. I went on Facebook and saw that she did go out for that meal and Everything and she still isn't messaging me so I finally snapped and deleted Facebook off of my phone but idk what to do rn, but it makes me think of I didn't give Casper her birthday presents would she still be talking to me am I the asshole for thinking this way.



Update; 
So she managed to get a hold of me today and I found out 
- Casper 100% had her birthday meal with bf and her mom and didn't even try messaging me to say I wasn't going
- she planned to hang out with me before her bf said all That stuff and she said she is busy all this week even though today she is visiting her family and then going the 2 hour journey to be with her bf and spending the rest of the week there.


For a side note that isn't a one off either she planned to hang with me the whole of last year before she even went with bf for Halloween and she patched me to smoke weed at his house 

She was supposed to see me the day I came out if hospital and she went and say bf instead

She was supposed to come over for new year because of what happened at Halloween and I was by myself and upset but once again went to her bfs

I'm really having second thoughts about her coming to see pink with me (my mom bought me 2 tickets and I said she could come) and for her coming to turkey with me and my family for my 18th since she doesn't want to spend one day with me unless I'm buying her something or taking her somewhere or giving her fags because she has none and I am really fed up with everything that's for the support in the comments.",
7904,"AITA for sleeping with a girl my friend wanted ? This happened last night.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I live in a student hall, and I hangout with a nice group of neighbors. They're super friendly, we drink beers, smoke weed and listen to awesome vinyls.
I'm used to hanging out with one particular dude, we like to have deep conversations about life, relationships etc. We'll call him Tim.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

The other day Tim told me that he has eyes on a certain girl. Erica. Erica has a boyfriend, but he's still attracted to her. She put him in the friendzone and leads him on by going on dates. They even slept together, but did nothing. She just likes taunting guys.
He says that his dream would be to have a threesome with Erica and my ex.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Last night we're having a party at Tim's place, and Erica is there. She keeps looking at me the whole night. Her friend Tiffany went to my ear and told to me :

- ""Go on, she likes you. You can bring her home tonight!"".

-  ""No way. Tim has eyes on her and he has kind of a crush. I can't do that to him"".

- ""Who cares ? It's only your neighbor"".

I still refuse and tell her that I can't do that to Tim. She asked me ""do you like her ?"" and I said yeah, she's hot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

She made obvious suggestions that there was something going on between me and Erica in front of everyone, including Tim. I was so embarassed. I didn't know how to react.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

On one hand, last year I broke up with my girlfriend of 1.5 years. Her memories were kind of surfacing again these past few days, and it felt really good to have a hot girl hitting on me. On the other hand, I feel weird about it because of Tim.

Tiffany told me ""Okay. She told me nothing will happen. She just needs a place to stay"". I finally give up and say fine, ok. But he can't know.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Her friend says ""I'm going to say to Tim that she's going to sleep at my place. Then she can just go to your place instead.""

&nbsp;&nbsp;

She does that, and then they leave, and other people as well.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Tim then says to me ""Damn it ! Erica was probably going to sleep here tonight, until Tiffany suggested she go with her! Fuck."" It seemed to really affect him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I said ""yeah... Fuck. That sucks."" and then I hung around for one last beer and left to my place.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I then meet Erica. She says ""I have a boyfriend. I just didn't want to sleep with Tim."" I replied ""Yeah sure, whatever. I got space it's no big deal.""

&nbsp;&nbsp;

While we were together in bed, I felt a bit awkward. She's quite younger than me (she's 20 I'm 27). I didn't really know what to talk about. She made sure not to sleep close enough, so I felt weird trying to make any move towards her.

Though she told me that she likes Tim only as a friend, because he's nice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Next morning, I'm feeling horny as hell. I think ""fuck it, I'm making a move"". So I start touching her around. Pretty soon I have my hand under her top. She's pretty into it and she puts her arm around me. I keep working on it, and I slowly approach the vagina. And right there she says ""no. you can play, but not there. I have a boyfriend"".

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I didn't feel comfortable about it so I didn't go any further .And got the bluest balls ever.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now I feel weird vis a vis of Tim. Am I the asshole for sleeping with her ?

&nbsp;&nbsp;

EDITS: I'm adding some things about the story that I forgot intially.
Just wanted to add that I did not know her age until she was actually in my bed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

**UPDATE** :  Okay so I felt like a huge piece of shit so I called Tim. I actually woke him up (it's midnight here) so he was kind of out of it. But I told him the whole story. He seemed upset then he said ""Yeah I knew she was that type of girl"". He seemed cool with me as well.",
52109,"WIBTA If I ghost a guy who just isnt getting the message? Yeah. Ik ghosting is shitty but my friends keep suggesting it and idk what to do. But like here me out. 


So I met this guy in my honors English class last semester. We were never really close or talk outside of class except for projects. Most if not all of our convos would consists of politics, discussing last nights readings or small talk. Classes ended early may and I havent heard from him till the middle of July. He texted me late at night something on the lines of this:

Him: hey, how are you? I know it's out of the blue, I just liked out conversations, but I was shy and stupid not to continue them so here I am trying to fix my mistakes lol. 

I thought this was super sweet and innocent. So I responded and queue small talk again for like 10min. Super dry conversation and I thought nothing of it really just that hes a friend. The next day he asks me to go to a tango class with him but throughout the convo he was hardcore flirting with me. I felt awkward so I would reply small things like ""lol"", ""haha"", ""weird flex but ok"" (that was after he said it takes two to tango and he's a really good lead😉. Bleh) I felt like an ass for the short replies (I am too forgiving for my own good, that's why I'm here). Anyways, I ended the convo early and went to bed. 
 

The week he started texted me I was incredably busy with work, helping my parents with home renovations and other chores so I was not in the mood or had the energy to have long convos with anyone really. He would text me every day even if I told him I was busy and cant talk. Towards the end of the week he got salty and said ""oh I see how things are"" and I just apologized and said I was busy but I'll text him when I'm free. I didnt hear from him for a week till last night at midnight he texted me ""hi"" on three different platforms (text, messenger and snapchat). My friends think hes being creepy and I should ghost him. I think that that would be a little much cause I never told him directly I'm not interested and I did say that I would text him when I'm free which I didnt comply. But at the same time it's an easy way out and he was being a little creepy. So WIBTA if I just ignore him completely?",
1603,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she’s becoming something she hates? So she recently got into a fight with her best friend, saying how she’s recently become a bitch and snapped at her during a competition and how she hasn’t been talking to her because she’s acting high and mighty, and never wants and always cancels at the last moment.

However, when I talk about that said friend, I ask for her side and she talked about how she was put in a position that would stress anyone out, and that she was acting “bitchy” because again, she was super stressed and had to tell people to stop talking during the competition. She’s been super stressed out about new things coming into her life. About the cancelling thing, she is more inclined to do things at the spur of the moment so let’s say someone wants to eat with her on Wednesday, but if she finds something better to do she’ll do that (yes I know that’s a dick thing to do, not here to argue that). The thing is, she explains everything and apologizes and wants to be friends with my girlfriend, and she truly means it.

However, my girlfriend wouldn’t have any of it and said how she was being a complete bitch and she also had things in her life that was stressing her out but she wasn’t gonna bring it out on anyway. Also, she thought that her friend was just adding more stress to her life and she wasn’t putting in the effort to be friends with her. 

Now, this is where things turn around. I call her out for being a bit of a hypocrite about this subject. Whenever my girlfriend is stressed, she does take it out on people. When it’s time to work, she will shut people down for the good of the group. And from past arguments, her saying “she’s not trying to be friends, why bother” is better applied to herself, not the friend. After some past disputes, some on her some on her friend, it always ends with her friend saying she wants to know what she could do to stay friends while my girlfriend just says “I’m done, it’s clear she doesn’t want to be friends”. 

So to sum things up, am I the asshole for pointing out that she’s being a bit of a hypocrite and want her to try to understand her friend’s current position?

We ended up hanging out accidentally a few months after we met, and quickly developed a very close friendship. What I did not know at this time was that she had begun to fall in love with me.

&#x200B;

Our friendship has always been rooted in complete honesty (to the point of sharing pretty much every passing thought), and so she ended up writing a letter to me, telling me about how she felt and apologizing for it, because she knew that despite the fact that I am an intense LGBTQ+ ally and advocate, I am both Christian and straight. After reading the letter, we met up talked about it for hours. I essentially told her I considered being with her romantically, but at the moment, I genuinely couldn't see myself in a relationship with her, because 

1. I wouldn't want to ruin the friendship
2. I wasn't sure if I wanted to date a girl
3. the family/cultural/religious stuff would make it hard for me to not feel guilty in that relationship, which would be unfair to her. 

She was just genuinely shocked I'd thought about it in any capacity whatsoever—and even more so that I didn't give her an outright no. However, because I left it so open, that made it difficult (read: impossible) for her to get over me.

&#x200B;

We became closer after this, and we currently function almost more as a non-romantic couple than as friends. We went on a trip together and it was phenomenal. We text and talk and think about each other all the time, and I can say that we genuinely love each other. The problem is, I am happy just having her in my life this way, but for her, it's like getting so intensely close to something she desperately wants (which is essentially a life together), but just missing the mark. It's hard for both of us: It might be easier on her if I shut down the idea of a romantic relationship entirely so that she can move on, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't deeply considering an actual relationship. Meanwhile, me being confusing and indecisive hurts her, because she's hanging on to a thread of hope that may or may not come into fruition. She also has opportunities to date other people, but doesn't want to—she says that she can't imagine liking someone that isn't me (which I think will change because people always say their crush/bf/gf/so is ""the one"" and that they'll ""never love again"", but she disagrees). Fundamentally, I desperately don't want to lead her on in any way, but I also don't want to lie and say either yes or no if I'm not sure. I care about her more than anything and want to be the best friend for her that I can be until I manage to make up my mind one way or the other.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: AITA for being unsure of my feelings towards my closest friend, and in that uncertainty, stringing her along for something that might or might not happen?

40111,"AITA for telling my boss I want to see him alone when his wife was in the office? It always drives me NUTS how whenever I want to meet with my boss his wife is at his office. His wife is the “co-owner” but doesn’t have a damn what this company is about and just sits through meetings and nods as if she knows what I’m talking about to him. I think because their company is successful they’re a little over their head and think they can freely break professional boundaries. His wife is useless and doesn’t really contribute anything to the company besides sitting beside her husband looking pretty. Usually I’m annoyed but don’t say anything when she’s there during a meeting. Today was the last straw because as I opened his office door I saw her giving him a shoulder rub. It was enough for me and I said “i want to see you alone and I’m not meeting with you if she’s there” and went home because I was angry. My boss emailed me that he wants a meeting with me tomorrow as soon as I come in. Can I get fired? Was what I did an asshole move or am I justified?



UPDATE:

What a joke of a company. If you thought I was the asshole last time just wait to see who the new asshole is. Today I went in to see what my boss emailed me about. When I walked in the office I found his wife, and 2 HR managers there and asked her where her husband was. She said she was meeting with me instead and asked me to sit down. So basically my boss didn’t respect my wishes from yesterday and decided to not only have his wife in a meeting AGAIN but he also didn’t show up himself. She told me they were letting me go and that the HR manager will walk me to my desk to pick up my stuff and leave. Notice how she thinks she’s too good that she needs another employee to walk me to my desk. Also, how unprofessional is it that she has 2 other employees with her (probably because she’s nervous to have her first one on one meeting). I felt humiliated because she could’ve done this privately. I tried to explain myself but she kept telling me that this was not a negotiation and this was a final decision. So she didn’t let me have a chance and was being a bitch. I couldn’t believe that my bosses wife was firing me and he wasn’t even here or didn’t care to see me on my last day at work. Every time I tried to discuss it with her she wouldn’t let me speak and said this was not up for negotiation. When I asked to see my boss his wife told me “I can’t discuss other employees with you”. I gave up. When the HR manager walked me to my desk I tried going to my e-mail to talk to my boss but I realized I had already been locked out of all the company’s network. So I couldn’t even send my coworkers goodbye messages. Honestly what an asshole company. Who’s the asshole now?

Update 2: I also want to mention that sometimes her and her husband do things besides the shoulder rubs like touching each other’s legs, hugging, and kissing at work. I know they’re married and all but in a workplace that’s just wrong.",
37897,"AITA for declining my mothers constant random calls? I’m a 26 F who lives out of state away from my parents and am pretty independent financially. 

My mother has an irritating habit of calling randomly - even during work hours or during times I specifically say I will be busy. 

I’ve told her to at least text my beforehand many many times so I can say whether or not its a good time.

If I don’t answer right away she then sends a barrage of texts tell me to respond or send a picture of myself because she’s “concerned”. If I ignore her for long enough she then threatens to call the police.

29726,"AITA for asking my landlord to reimburse me for supplies I was storing outside? This isn't really that big of a situation but I just want to see some external reasoning. I'll be clear about as much as I can.

The apartment I rent has an area outside near the parking lot where my landlord has been storing a bunch of old furniture and equipment. Sometimes we get scavengers who come looking through, which you obviously don't want happening.

Anyway, my landlord came to clean some of the old furniture up recently, and in the process took my storage box which had my cleaning supplies in it. I kept the box outside because I don't want fumes inside my apartment (yes, just a little strange but not a bad idea). The box was well protected from weather. It was kept in a pretty discrete area, but among other furniture that my landlord had decided to finally start cleaning up after many months. I never told him or anyone because it seemed harmless.

The landlord plans on giving me my storage box back, but in case the internals are missing I asked if he could reimburse me $20 for the supplies. He went on about how I can't keep stuff outside like that and that it is ""common sense"" that I should have labeled it. I responded to him but didn't get to completely explain what I had in mind. For example, I didn't want to label and draw any sort of attention to the box. I wanted it to look like it had little value so no one would bother ($20 box, $20 in supplies). I said he should've identified it as a tenant's stuff and not his, and he kept saying that he thought it was trash and he was cleaning up to make the area look nicer. But explaining to me sort of in a way that completely takes away responsibility from himself while making me look all in the wrong. He doesn't sound or act like a total a-hole, just straight forward and neutral, so it's not like I feel I've been verbally harassed. It's just the act of him talking down to me about the box being kept outside that got me worked up.

I understand he wants to minimize scavengers looking through things on the property. I understand he assumed all of the stuff in that pile was his, because he told me he's never had a tenant keep their own stuff outside like that. I understand that ""common sense"" says you shouldn't keep your own stuff in a public area or in a common area of a property (of course I wouldn't keep anything of real value in a common area). But I still thought what I was doing was fine and it *was*, especially because my box wasn't really making the pile look worse. His pile of junk isn't completely cleared yet, so I can't say what his argument is if he doesn't plan on completely cleaning up anyway. 

So, we ended the call agreeing he'd return the box to me, however with no reimbursement if he can't find my supplies. I won't be super pissed if I have to re-buy some things, but I just want to know what you all think here? Did I not think things through enough? Was he just trying to cover himself for his mistakes? Was it not ok to keep the box in a common area?",
76558,"AITA for refusing to quit a friendship my GF doesn't aprove? Being introduced to this sub via youtube I thought it was time to post my story. 

So, I used to be the chairman of a study association. Our study association is a member of another broader association that has the purpose to organise bigger events for students, like parties and drinks in our joint society, or lectures that are interesting for all students. Via joint meetings of the ""broader association"" with other ""study associations"" who are also members, i met a girl a couple of years younger than me. We chatted a lot during drinks after meetings and even started hanging out from time to time. We were friends, nothing more. Other people noticed that we were close and wondered if we were dating, but we always said no to that as we both agreed to be friends, nothing more. We also chat alot with each other via whatsapp, as she lives in a different city. This is important for later on.

Later that year I started dating a girl who was a committee member of my study association. She's great and it feels like we really connect. We are still dating, and we decided to go on a city trip. She had already noticed how close I was with this ""association girl"" and I had already ensured her that we were nothing more than friends. But every time I recieve a text from her, and my girlfriend notices, she looks at me with jealous eyes. This ofcourse had to also happen when we were having lunch in a restaurant. She noticed texts coming in on my phone, checked from who they were and asked me what it was between me and this ""association girl"". I told her I already tried to ensure her that we were just friends, nothing more, and that we texted because ""association girl"" lived in a different city. She went quiet after that and we didn't say much to me the rest of our trip. On our way back to our home I asked why it was such a big issue for her. She basically said that she worried I was cheating on her with ""association girl"". I was shocked. I said to her that we were nothing more than friends and she had nothing to worry about. Then she told me ""if you really like me, then stop contacting that girl"". I basically refused to quit my friendship with ""association girl"" and said she should trust me and that trust is the basis of any relationship. 

I told this story to my sister and mother and they agreed with my girlfriend. They said to me that if I really should end contact with that ""association girl"" if I really cared for my girlfriend. I still refuse to do it, in my opinion I can choose who my friends are, female or male. I told this my girlfriend in a telephone call too. She told me that I could, but this was a different case as me and ""association girl"" were really close and other people ""also suspected that we were in a relationship of some sorts"". That happened two weeks ago and I haven't seen her since. We usually see each other every weekend.

21695,"AITA for sticking up for my SO and making his mom cry? AITA for sticking up for my SO and making his mother cry?

SO and I are in our early 30's. Recently he has been struggling with anxiety/depression. He experiences a lot of guilt as a part of this. As a result, he has mostly stopped communicating with his family because they push him to talk about things that make him anxious and will guilt him for not calling. Its not like he's cut them out of his life, he just puts off communication until he feels ready for it, which admittedly can last a really long time.

MIL eventually got fed up and decided to come for an unexpected 4 day visit. This upset me because it felt like an ambush and ultimately made SO feel worse. I try to be understanding as I know she is just worried about him, but she could have at least asked when would be a good time to visit (to me, if he isnt responding) rather than just urgently coming. The context of this visit really made him feel very out of control and embarrassed so he decided to talk to her and tell her that this trip was a violation of his privacy and wasn't ok to do. MIL claimed she had no choice, he wasn't talking to her so she had to come. Privately I felt it was very selfish of her, she came to ease her own anxieties without considering how it might make him feel.

At the end of an awkward trip, I snapped. MIL was getting ready to leave, reiterating to SO that he needs to call more and laying the guilt on heavily. She was telling him how hurt his father is that he wont call, asking if he was mad at his father?, and explaining how his father thinks he is going to die soon (he's not, but is a heavy smoker and is anticipating getting a cancer diagnosis despite not having any issues currently) and he will die thinking his son doesn't love him.

&#x200B;

I snapped, ""I'm not sure guilt is the right approach here,""

MIL: ""well then what is?""

Me: ""Patience and understanding... he's an adult"" and then I left the room.

&#x200B;

I definitely said it in a frustrated way. Up until this point I had tried really hard to be smiley + friendly, so I think that my outburst hit extra hard. Then MIL left for the airport crying.

I tried reaching out to SO's sister and we had a really heated conversation in which she told me plainly that he needs to call his family. I don't disagree, but I suggested that they be understanding of what he's experiencing and allow him some space. She said his behavior indicates that either he's really rude or something is seriously wrong and when tried explaining, he doesn't want to call because his family just makes him feel bad by guilting him, she told me she was too frustrated to talk to me and hung up.

It sounds like nobody wants to hear how to help support him, they just expect him to change and I dont think thats a fair ask so I'm the villain. So AITA?",

72266,"WIBTA for telling my boss I don't want to help students with special needs? I'm a STEM tutor on campus for a year now, and recently there's been a student, clearly with special needs, seeking help from the tutoring centre. I've helped her out multiple times, and it has always ended up with me giving her the answers instead of the usual way of tutors helping students by having a discussion/looking for answers together whatnot. My experience include:

1 - There were multiple times where I've walked through similar problems with her and gave answers to those questions, and when I asked her to try it out, she just takes the pencil and starts drawing on the paper.

2 - There was also a time when I told her, ""I think you should revisit this concept because it feels to me that you don't fully understand the solution that was presented"", only for her to respond ""I know what you're talking about."", which I'm 100% sure it's not true.

3 - Getting ignored by the student whenever I ask for feedback about what she thinks about a particular question, to the point where I'd tell her the answers to her assignments, but she just refuses to budge to write it down and just sits there and does nothing...

I'm not a very patient person in general, and I've never worked/lived with people with special needs, and I don't think it's fair for me to have to go through this simply because my contract/job description never mentioned that I'll have to be prepared to tutor students with special needs; even if we have, I think this requires proper training and understanding of the spectrum, which this training doesn't even exist for this job. I've brought this up to my boss once, and she simply said that I could ask the student what are the ways that we can make her learn better, which I did ask the student, but only to get ignored. I'm going to go to my boss again, and I won't ask her how to handle situations like these anymore because my boss didn't give me a solution the first time I asked, so I'm just going to tell her that I'm not going to help students with special needs anymore unless we get proper training for this to be my responsibility.

Thanks for responding, I realised that I have most definitely phrased the question and the last part of my post incorrectly, when I wrote **""...so I'm just going to tell her that I'm not going to help students with special needs anymore..."".** I am aware that special needs or not, everyone learns differently. However I do still stand by the fact that I'm not going to help someone who just waits for me to do her work for her. I've not talked to my boss about this yet, but I will make sure my boss understands that it's just this particular student.",
17830,"AITA For not wanting my parents to surprise my twin sister with a visit for our birthday. For my and my twin sister’s 30th birthday, I made plans with her boyfriend to fly in and surprise her, since I live in a different country and we haven’t spent our birthday together in years. She will be THRILLED, knowing her. I told my parents when I booked the ticket, and they asked if they could come along too, and we could all spend our 30th together - great! I love my family, I don’t get to see them enough, and I was super happy we’d all get to be together. 

I did say I thought they should tell her they were coming, because I thought it would be more special for me to show up as a surprise, but they also wanted to be a part of the reveal. I said okay, and we could make that decision later.

It’s getting closer to the date, so my sister’s boyfriend and I have been making more specific plans. I called my parents to fill them in, and they dropped on me that my aunt wanted to come too...and that she’s already bought her plane ticket. At this point, it was starting to feel like it wasn’t my trip or my surprise anymore, like my parents have co-opted it, so I asked them to tell my sister that they and my aunt were coming, and my arrival would still be a surprise.

My mother is pushing back in the group planning message thread, saying she “has some concerns” about doing that, since sister’s boyfriend has already told her to take the Friday and Monday off work for something he’s planning, and that my sister is going to get suspicious. 

I sent them a message this morning to say that I was disappointed with how it was panning out. Firstly because my big gift was flying in as a surprise, and it feels less special if everyone is doing it, and secondly because it now feels like it’s her special surprise birthday weekend and everyone is making a big deal about surprising her for it ...but it’s also my birthday too! 

Also (my parents don’t know this), my sister’s boyfriend asked me a long time ago, when I first started arranging my travel plans and it was meant to be just me there, if I minded him proposing to my sister that weekend. He’s wonderful, and I couldn’t be happier for them, so I said yes, of course! But now it feels like everything else is going to overshadow my weekend with my sister. Also, I’m now a little worried that she’ll think her boyfriend arranged for everyone to be there for the proposal and not that it was my surprise that I arranged for her.

Am I being too difficult and controlling about this trip? I’m worried they’re going to think I’m being precious about being the center of attention...and maybe I am?",
37783,"WIBTA for writing a book that I know would hurt a mentally ill former friend? I struggled with mental health issues for most of my childhood and adolescence, and almost all of my friends growing up were ""problem kids.""  I don't think any of us were bad people, but all of our problems combined to create an incredibly dysfunctional friend group.  I'd like to write a memoir about our experiences, but I know that at least one ex-friend would be extremely hurt by this.

""Kayla"" was my childhood best friend and would be a major character in my book.  I believe that in what I've written so far, I've presented her fairly: she could be arrogant and abrasive, but this was because she was struggling with several mental illnesses (borderline, PTSD, and others) and trauma from an abusive childhood.  (And obviously, I am changing names and details to protect her identity.)

Still, I know that if I publish this and she ever finds out about it, she will be very upset.  A lot of what I discuss is deeply personal (for instance, the abuse and neglect she suffered).  I'm sure that having any of this published, even with her identity obscured, would leave her feeling violated.  I also think that she would be angry at the negative light in which her family is portrayed.  For most of her childhood, she was in denial that her parents were abusive, and I think that even now, she would feel defensive of them.  Also, she expressed a desire in the past to write her own memoir about her life, and would probably feel hurt by me ""stealing"" her story.

I have not been in contact with Kayla for several years.  I'd like to interview some of my other childhood friends if they're willing, but I'm scared even to contact Kayla and tell her I'm writing about her, because I know that conversation would not go well.

I feel like I'm the asshole because I want to write about another person's problems in a way that I know would hurt them.  At the same time, I feel like that's unreasonable: if writers had to respect everyone's wishes, almost no biographical writing could be published.  I've been going back and forth on this for several years and can't decide whether what I'm thinking of doing is okay or not.  I think I have a right to write about events that I witnessed, but I also can't shake the feeling that I'm doing something really wrong.

&#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are asking why I want to share this information to begin with and whether I need to disclose Kayla's abuse to tell my story.  So, what I'm struggling with is that as a result of abuse, Kayla acted out in ways that negatively affected me.  For instance, I had depression that became a lot worse when she consistently told me I was ugly/stupid/etc.  Obviously I can discuss that without going into her backstory.  The reason why I wanted to delve into her backstory is that without that context, she comes off badly, and that isn't really a fair portrayal.  She did a lot of inappropriate things, and they were pretty much all motivated by trauma.",
37420,"AITA for not wanting my sister-in-law to visit her own home?   

For context, my girlfriend and I live in a duplex that we rent from her SIL (who we'll call Jamie) who lives in a different city. She originally bought the house because she was going to move there with her kids and husband (who is my girlfriend's brother. Also we'll call him Mark), but after Mark got a better job in their home town, they decided to cancel the move and just buy another house in their hometown instead. Now they are left with a duplex and that is where my girlfriend and I are staying now.  Now the issue is, Jamie and Mark want to bring their kids on a vacation, and seeing that they have a duplex here, they want to stay in there in order to save money. 

Now, I know this doesn't sound that bad, but let me give you some info about these guys. First, they are lazy. For example, neither one of them wants to drive anywhere. Jaime can't drive because she doesn't have a license, even though she's a stay at home mom and has all the time in the world to study and practice to get one. Mark has a CDL even, but whenever he visits he says he ""doesn't know the roads well enough"" and asks my girlfriend to drive him everywhere. 

Second, they like to put their responsibilities on everyone else. Whenever they visit, Mark and Jamie always like to go out for 6 hours a day, leaving us to cook for and take care of the kids for the majority of what little free time we have. Even when they are home, they almost expect us to cook for them. They love to eat rice but they never make it, so when it's almost dinner time they're always like ""Oh, we want rice but there's none left, can you make some?"" 

Third, they don’t even control their kid’s bedtime, so the kids are up until 1am, and start making noise again at 6am (they take naps around 5pm). This really does not work with my girlfriend’s or my work schedule, since I’m taking classes and work fulltime and my girlfriend works 10 hours a day.

And lastly, they are just infuriatingly unreasonable. If they want something, they go get it no matter what, and never compromise. Once they wanted to go to an Asian buffet that was 2 cities over, and we had to drive them for 30 minutes to get them there, even though there's like 15 Asian buffets in my city that are exactly like it.

My girlfriend and I have both talked about it, and we absolutely do not want them to visit because of how much stress they cause us. But, this also kind of makes me feel like an asshole because while they are a nuisance, they do help us out with the cheaper rent. Normally we would have to pay about $550-600/month, but because we take care of the place, they dropped it down to $400-450 for us. This includes lawn care, maintenance, and finding people to rent the other side of the duplex. Another thing is that there is still one room open for them to use, so there is enough space for them to be here, although it will be a little cramped. 

So reddit, are my girlfriend and I assholes for not wanting them here?

30173,"WIBTA if I dramatically reduced my deceased husband’s parents' contact with our kids? My husband unexpectedly died about 4 years ago. We have 3 kids who are now in elementary school. After my husband’s death, I moved about 2 hours away to my parents’.

My husband’s parents (my in-laws) were also devastated. He was their only child. They pressured me against moving but eventually we compromised by having the kids visit them for major holidays and a couple weeks in the summer. The boys love this because my in-laws host large holiday celebrations and spoil them to hell and back. My in-laws have also insisted on paying for private schools for the boys, which I did not ask for but appreciate because the public schools here are not very good. My in-laws and I do not get along very well but they are great grandparents.

I have since met someone else and become pregnant and engaged. My in-laws have said unkind things about this to other relatives but I understand that they are still grieving my husband’s death. They have expressed minimal interest in my pregnancy and I do not think they will ever love this child as much as they love my other children.

I do not want my future child to feel like a second class citizen in the family. I plan to pull my kids from private school after they finish elementary because I cannot guarantee my in-laws will pay for my future child in 5 years. Going forward, I would like my kids grandparents to visit instead of sending my kids to visit them. I want to celebrate holidays with just my kids and fiance to ensure they are treated equally and to improve our family bond. I would still allow my in-laws to visit as they like, as long as they are equally kind to my future child, but there is no room for them to stay over and the boys’ grandfather's health concerns make visiting us difficult. Imposing these rules will nearly cut them out.

**Edit: I have no intention of cutting contact with my in-laws.** My kids will still be reminded to call them and make them presents, as they always have been. My in-laws are welcome to visit whenever they would like. It is just unlikely my in-laws can visit much.

**Edit:** Since this has come up regularly, my fiance only has a mother who lives with his sibling in another state. She's very excited for the baby but is dependent on his sibling and cannot afford to express her love in the same manner my in-laws can.

**Edit 2:** Thanks everyone. After reading through the comments, I've decided to talk to the grandparents about paying for the youngest child's K-12 education. I did not expect them to pay for any of my kids to go to private school, but I would rather they all go or none go. It is a huge and obvious difference in treatment for kids living in the same home. If they are hesitant, I will move everyone to public school and the grandparents can save their money to help the older 3 with college. The public schools around here are not horrible, just not as good as the private.

I will continue the kids' summer visits and we'll all start going to Thanksgiving as a complete family (previously, only the kids attended). We'll start our own traditions for Christmas and Easter.",

73473,"AITA for being too assertive and suggesting strategies to overcome an introvert behavior? I met this person a few weeks ago and we have been exchanging texts now and then. I was kind of taken back when she posted a Vlog of herself talking about how to cope with feeling down. And because I have dealt with the issues myself, I instantly recognized signs of depression and loneliness. 
 

I do have a soft spot for people dealing with those issues, so I decided to probe a little bit further and be more engaging with the conversation. We were bouncing off ideas for upcoming events when she said she cannot do those activities because she is not very social. 
 

I have been in the same shoes, so I suggested some tips and strategies to overcome her shyness such as ways to engage people in a conversation or how to thread a specific topic in a discussion. 
 

All of a sudden, I received an angry wall of text accusing me of being overly assertive and trying to decide her personality as I said she didn’t seem introverted to me from the interaction I have had with her. I said I thought she just seemed normal to me. The conversation was pretty much one sided at this point with her ranting on an introverted vs extroverted dynamic. 
 

I am upset with the way the conversation turned, and at this point, I would be more than happy to ghost her and walk off. I really don’t need that shit and drama going in my life right now, but for some reason I find myself caring for this person due to the same mental issues she is going through. 
 

Am I in the wrong here? And have I over stepped by boundaries?",

He just looks fucking stupid honestly but apparently some other people think he (and his friends who do it) are cool. One day he was walking down the stairs and his pants we're almost near his knees and he tripped falling all the way down the stairs. Me and my friend megan laugh our assess off. He ended up chipping a tooth and had to get that fixed. A teacher saw this and told us to go the principal's office and she decided to give us detention over the issue. I think this is fucking ridiculous. My parent's called the school and said we had a family emergency during the time of our detention (thanks mom i love you) so we won't be serving it. They moved the date of the detention and again we had the same family emergency. Principal decided to give up. Im wondering though was it a dick move to laugh at him? he hasn't been sagging too much since, only by a couple inches.

This happened a year or two ago but it jut came to my mind but my freshman year of college my younger brother got me pretty nice Nike jacket for Christmas. I wore the jacket pretty often the second semester and when the weather started to warm up I stopped. My roommate had a small reputation for stealing things within his high school friend group and I had been warned to keep an eye out on my things. Since it was spring I didn’t realize my jacket was gone until the end of the semester when we were packing up to go home. I honestly just thought I lost it and charged it to the game and moved on. 

Fast forward to sophomore year and his new roommate was a mutual friend of ours that we met the previous year. The new roommate texts me a couple of days before the semester starts and asks me had he ever stolen anything from me bc he had gotten the same warnings and I honestly said no but come to think of it I can’t find my jacket my brother got me and sent him a picture of the jacket. He told me thanks and that he’d keep and eye out for it. A couple months into the semester the new roommate texts me a picture of my old roommate in the exact jacket I lost and tells me how he’s been saying his mom got it for him and this and that which I know is complete bs. So the new roommate invites me over and while my old roommate was in the shower I took it back. ",

Just wondering if I would be the asshole in this situation. My girlfriend and I have been through this before, her family is going away for a weekend trip and can't find anyone to look after her dogs. I love dogs in general, and she has two. The two dogs are generally good dogs, but one of them has accidents inside the house at a pretty high rate and also has very bad anxiety that leads to quite a need for attention.   


I live at home still, and I don't want to bring the dogs to my house as we recently had to put down the only dog we've had as a family and wouldn't want to have a constant reminder around the first weekend after his passing.  I also don't want to cancel all my weekend plans to stay at her house with the dogs either, as I feel like its not my responsibility to take after these dogs if they can't find a place for them.

I have worked in restaurants before and know how annoying it is when people come in and order food right before closing.

8686,"AITA for telling a student I could see her underwear? I'm a male high school teacher, and I've been at this for a few years. I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. 

One of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. 

Over the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. 

I realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.

Finally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was ""your underwear is showing.""

When she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.

I've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.

Let's call this boss George. George started lying to me about what he thinks I'm doing bad at, but he wouldn't man up and tell me he thought this. He told me that the other managers said this. Not only this, but he would tell the other managers (he was the store manager, the others were just regular managers so they couldn't do anything).

So my stepdad’s been trying to kickstart his own lawn care business, and my girlfriend’s family (who I stay with) has been needing somebody to do the lawn for us, as we don’t own any mower. While I know it’s cheaper in the long run to just buy a mower and do it one’s self, I thought it’d be nice of me to help my father out and give him a regular client to service. He insisted on charging me a reduced rate but I ended up giving him extra a lot of times anyway.

39294,"AITA with regards to suits for my wedding? I'm due to get married soon and started looking at suits the weekend just past, my bride to be and I found the best possible suit for our color scheme too. We looked at the price and was informed due to my field of work I can receive 20% discount of the total cost, bringing the total from $300 to $240, bearing in mind this is a 3 piece suit from a reputable suit retailer too and the quality is very good.

&#x200B;

I have one best man and 4 groomsmen, upon sharing the link for the suit into the group chat one groomsman noticed you can hire suits and said it'd be a cheaper alternative. I looked into hiring and it turns out the suit I'd like for us to all wear isn't covered in the hire scheme and that the closest color was too bright. I hosted a poll with buy / hire and the results were 5 for buying their own suits and 1 for hire which was the groomsman who initially mentioned hiring in the first place.

&#x200B;

Here's where the issue begins... said groomsman is extremely tight with his finances, he's had the comfortable life of mum and dad paying for most things for example... He went to university and his parents paid for his student accommodation for 3 years, they bought him a top line macbook for uni too. He even pesters people for things like lending them $2 three weeks a go or if he bought them a drink he'll pester relentlessly until he has the money back, he's recently traveled to a few countries in Europe too and when it comes to going out drinking he'll take a fair amount out with him too, my issue is that he also boasts about how much he's got saved which is around $3,000 and goes on about how hard he works etc, to my knowledge he only works weekends. Another gripe is he claims he'll never wear this suit again so to him it seems like an unnecessary expense... Even though it's for MY wedding. My other issue is his brother is my best man and works a lot more than him has minimal savings, is paying for uni himself and has a lot more outgoings than said groomsman and said he wants to buy his own suit!?

&#x200B;

Bottom line was also mentioned that if he cant buy he'll go against me and hire a different color suit and I point blank refused and informed him if he did, he'd no longer be a groomsman because the photos wouldn't look right.

36411,"AITA for not letting my partner sleep in This has been an occasional, ongoing argument (nothing serious, but we both get a little peeved with the other). And it basically comes down to: He would like to sleep in sometimes during the week, having me get up with the kids for school. I feel this is inconsiderate to ask for. And I'm aware, going based on just that, I DEFINITELY sound like tah...but bear with me  


  
There are definitely a few relevant points to this:  


\-This is specifically in the past 6 months. He got laid off work and is not currently working. I'm a stay at home mom. Previous to him losing his job, I was almost exclusively getting up with the kids, including an 8month period where I was effectively the only parent (he was away for work for those 8 months. During that time, he was home a total of 4 days). He usually works away from home a lot as well (gone for 2-4 days at a time)  
\-he falls asleep almost immediately. I have an ongoing battle with insomnia. It's been almost lifelong, but has gotten much worse in the last two years. It's rare that I fall asleep before 3am, no matter what I have tried. I'm still looking into options and help, and at this point am seriously considering more serious measures (melatonin, meditation, etc have been tried). But getting up at 6:30am means I'm frequently getting apx 3-4 hours of sleep on a decent nights. And I find it very difficult to fall back to sleep, so once I'm awake, I'm up for the day. I also cannot nap (he can and does), as it throws my sleep off even more.  


\-His version of 'sleeping in' is sleeping until noonish (the timing is not what bothers me, that's whatever). That gives him 12-14 hours of sleep for that night. I wake up 10-11am, giving me, ON A GOOD NIGHT, a maximum of about 8hrs of sleep. It is frequently less than that, more an average of 5-6 hours a night, although some nights it's more like 3hrs, at times less.  


\-He DOES sleep in on most weekends because the kids don't have school or anything to do in the morning. They're old enough to be independent, make their own breakfast and all that (this has never been an issue), so he sleeps in on the weekends (which I don't mind at all and is not an issue).   


  
He says it's unfair to expect him to get up \*every\* morning to make sure the kids get to school, and would prefer to split it more evenly (even 3/2). I say it's unfair to expect me to lose out on large chunks of what little sleep I can get when there's a perfectly capable parent who can deal with things that need to be done.  


He works hard, and I appreciate it. But he's not working right now. And I'm struggling. I've been struggling for a while (and attempting to fix or improve it), and if he were working and when he starts working again, I will happily go back to getting up with the kids (and suffering through it), but I don't feel out of line taking advantage of the situation that allows me to actually get a proper amount of sleep each night.

2766,"AITA for being mad at my mom for getting married on a trip? * Originally, my mom invited me to go on a trip for her boyfriend's daughter that is turning 21.  I accepted and was really excited to go on this trip as this would be nice to go on a trip with my mom and other family to celebrate my mom's boyfriends daughters 21st birthday.  


* Well, my mom sat me down and told me how she doesn't want me to go with them anymore.  Her reasoning behind this being, that I am 18 and everyone else going on this trip will be 21 years old or over and that I won't be able to participate in some of the trip activities due to my age.  After she tells me that I am now univited, she then proceeds to tell me that she will also be getting married to her boyfriend on the trip for his daughter's birthday. 


* Her side to all of this is that she doesn't see the issue with her getting married while on the trip, after saying that I'm not allowed to go on the trip, because they will have a reception and what not when they return home and that I can just attend that in place of actually being at their wedding.  


* In my opinion, I have every right to be mad and upset at her for doing what she did.  I felt as if though what she did is very disrespectful.  I also do realize that it is her wedding and she has every right to have whoever she wants present, but this seems to be extremely uncharacteristic of my mom as I am her own son and we have also had a great relationship throughout my whole life.

16794,"AITA for making a another dad make his kid cry? First time poster here.

This happened this past summer. 

We live in a HCOL area. Lots of wealthy/entitled people. We are not poor, but (very) far from wealthy. 

The wife and I take our kids to the local public park. Now, this park is awesome and FREE. It has a huge splash park, three playgrounds, tennis courts, paved nature trails, etc.

The final cool feature it has, is a full sized carousel. This is the only thing that costs anything, besides stuff at the concession stand. It’s $5 USD per child, per ride. This is where the conflict occurs. 

After a fun morning of splash pad, my wife and I decide to get our kiddos some ice cream and then head to the carousel because you have to buy tickets at the concession stand. The carousel only runs every 15 minutes and by the time we get to the carousel people/kids are piling in. Now, my son can be picky and normally I don’t play along with his pickiness unless he’s willing to be a big kid about it. So, when we see the only seat left is a non-moving horse, intended for very small children, I ask if he would like to wait 15 minutes for the next one to get a better seat. He says yes and waits, just being a good kid, eating his ice cream and choosing the type of seat he wants. 

He settles on an eagle. It’s huge and colorful and he's really excited for it. 

Cue the Other Dad (OD). We make small talk ask our boys, who were about the same age, which animal they are going to pick. My son says the eagle, the other little boy says a lion. Cool. 

At some point in our 15 minutes we talk about how our local movie theater is great because you can pick your seat ahead of time and not be at the will of the “Social Contract” of waiting in line for your turn to pick a seat. From this I get the feeling that we’re both on board with the seat choices and the way our next shared experience should go. I was wrong. 

As soon as we get let into the carousel OD flat out runs right to the eagle and plops his son right on to it. 

I gotta be honest, I was flabbergasted. Normally, I would have just been like “oh well, dude’s a jerk” and helped my son pick another seat. I didn’t this time. I just had had a conversation with this guy. WTH?!

I looked right at the guy and said “ Really?! We just talked about this” He shrugged, as if to say “tough cookies.” 

Nope. Not good enough. 

Now, because of the nature of this ride the seats filled up quickly around us. I looked at him AGAIN and said “Really?” It was uncomfortable, to say the least. 

After a few VERY tense moments, he picked his kid up and moved him to another seat. And his kid started bawling his eyes out. It was bad. I felt bad. I still kind of do. 

I picked my son up and put him on the eagle and he thoroughly enjoyed his ride. We walked home with our ice cream cones. 

So, AITA?

TLDR;
I made a kid cry because I made his dad give my son a seat on a carousel after we had all discussed which seats we were picking.

68568,"WIBTA if I round up a student's grade? I teach at a medium-large high school, meaning I'm not super familiar with all of my students and their backgrounds. 

At parent-teacher conferences last night I met a junior's parents who let me know that he was looking to get into some really top brand-name type schools. That is an anomaly here because it is an urban district with most kids going to state schools.

They weren't (just) bragging about this, they actually had a point about something unrelated.

So I had no clue that this kid was aiming so high, although he is the best student in my class and obviously a critical thinker and intelligent.

I pulled up his grades and it turns out he has an absolutely perfect GPA and even above perfect with weighted classes all the way back to sixth grade. *That is, until my class.*

For some reason this kid forgot something near the beginning of the year or Etc where he's like a couple points off ""perfect 4.0"" for my class. Basically he has an A minus, well a 3.5 

I'm thinking of bumping him up to an A/4.0 because:

My reasons are 
1) I don't offer extra credit.
2) If my question is ""has the student completely mastered the material up to now"", the answer is a resounding yes. The kid has been perfect on tests et cetera, he obviously knows the stuff and he's obviously the most versed kid in the room on my subject.
3) I'm an idiot and didn't build in a lot of wiggle room for me in my grading structure.
4) it's too late to give extra credit now because the quarter ended yesterday before conferences.

I guess I would not do this because I have no reason to do it for any other students. I gave the kids the grading scale and if I go hardcore by the grading scale he won't get a 4.0. He'll know I bumped him up because he is one of those kids that keeps track of his own grades. It's unfair? Idk. Feels slimy?

TLDR: after finding out a kid is going to try for big-name colleges, I realized I would be the only person who gave him less than a four-point in his last seven years of life. And I kind of feel like he did earn a 4.0, but according to my grading structure, he did NOT.",
